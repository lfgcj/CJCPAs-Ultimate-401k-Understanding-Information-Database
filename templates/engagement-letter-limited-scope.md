Dear [Plan Administrator Name]:

This letter confirms our understanding of the terms and objectives of our
engagement and the nature and limitations of the services we will provide.

SCOPE OF SERVICES
-----------------

You have requested that we audit the financial statements of the [PLAN NAME]
(the "Plan"), sponsored by [COMPANY NAME] (the "Plan Sponsor"), which
comprise the statements of net assets available for benefits as of
December 31, [YEAR] and [YEAR-1], and the related statements of changes in
net assets available for benefits for the years then ended, and the related
notes to the financial statements.

LIMITED SCOPE AUDIT ELECTION

In accordance with 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), you have elected to have the audit not extend
to investment information certified by [CUSTODIAN/TRUSTEE NAME], which is
regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a federal
or state agency.

This election means that we will not perform auditing procedures with respect
to the investment information prepared and certified by the qualified
institution, except for:
- Comparing the certified investment information with the related financial
  statements and supplemental schedules
- Reading the certified investment information for completeness

AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES
--------------------------

We will conduct our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent
limitations of internal control, an unavoidable risk exists that some
material misstatements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly
planned and performed in accordance with GAAS.

FORM OF REPORT

Because of the significance of the matters described above relating to the
limited scope election, we will not obtain sufficient appropriate audit
evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion on the financial statements
as a whole. Accordingly, we will not express an opinion on these financial
statements.

We will issue a report containing a disclaimer of opinion that will include:
- A section describing the scope and nature of the ERISA-permitted limited
  scope audit
- A section disclaiming an opinion on the financial statements due to the
  limitation resulting from the limited scope election
- An opinion on the form and content of the supplemental schedules in
  relation to the financial statements as a whole

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES
-----------------------------

Our audit will be conducted on the basis that management and, when
appropriate, those charged with governance acknowledge and understand that
they have the following responsibilities that are fundamental to our
undertaking the audit in accordance with GAAS:

1. For the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
   in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
   United States of America

2. For the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control
   relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements
   that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error

3. To provide us with:
   a. Access to all information of which management is aware that is relevant
      to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements,
      such as records, documentation, and other matters
   b. Additional information that we may request from management for the
      purpose of the audit
   c. Unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine
      it necessary to obtain audit evidence

4. For maintaining a current plan instrument, including all plan amendments

5. For administering the Plan and determining that the Plan's transactions
   that are presented and disclosed in the financial statements are in
   conformity with the Plan's provisions, including maintaining sufficient
   records with respect to each of the participants, to determine the
   benefits due or which may become due to such participants

6. For maintaining the Plan's tax-qualified status

7. For compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including ERISA

8. For ensuring that certified investment information is prepared and
   certified by a qualified institution that meets the requirements of
   29 CFR 2520.103-8

As part of our audit process, we will request from management and, when
appropriate, those charged with governance, written confirmation concerning
representations made to us in connection with the audit in a representation
letter to be signed at the conclusion of the audit.

SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES

We will also subject the following supplemental schedules to the auditing
procedures applied in our limited scope audit of the financial statements:
- Schedule H, Line 4i - Schedule of Assets (Held at End of Year)
- Schedule H, Line 4a - Schedule of Delinquent Participant Contributions
  (if applicable)
- Schedule G - Financial Transaction Schedules (if applicable)

We will issue an opinion on whether the supplemental schedules are fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements
as a whole.

FORM 5500 REVIEW

As a service to you, we will review the Form 5500 series return/report for
consistency with the audited financial statements; however, the preparation
and filing of Form 5500 is your responsibility.

COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE

We are responsible for communicating significant matters related to the
audit that are, in our professional judgment, relevant to the responsibilities
of those charged with governance in overseeing the financial reporting
process. We will communicate such matters as required by professional
standards.
