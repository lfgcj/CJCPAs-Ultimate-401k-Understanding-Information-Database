Re: Communication with Those Charged with Governance
    [PLAN NAME]
    Year Ended December 31, [YEAR]


Dear Plan Committee Members:

We have completed our limited scope audit of the financial statements of
the [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan") for the year ended December 31, [YEAR], and
have issued our report thereon dated [REPORT DATE]. Professional standards
require that we communicate certain matters to those charged with
governance of the Plan. This letter provides those required communications.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED AUDITING STANDARDS
--------------------------------------------------------------

As communicated in our engagement letter dated [DATE], our responsibility,
as described by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. Because
of the limited scope election under 29 CFR 2520.103-8, we did not perform
auditing procedures on the certified investment information. Accordingly,
we were unable to express an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

Our responsibility does not include establishing or maintaining internal
controls or assuring compliance with the plan document, ERISA, or the
Internal Revenue Code. However, we communicate internal control matters
and other findings that come to our attention during the audit.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT MATTERS
-------------------------

Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices

Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate
accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the Plan
are described in Note 2 to the financial statements.

[Choose one of the following:]

[If no new accounting policies:]
No new accounting policies were adopted and the application of existing
policies was not changed during the year.

[If new accounting policies adopted:]
During the year, the Plan adopted [describe new accounting policy]. We
believe the new policy is appropriate and consistent with industry practice.

We noted no transactions entered into by the Plan during the year for
which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. All
significant transactions have been recognized in the financial statements
in the proper period.

Accounting Estimates

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements
prepared by management and are based on management's knowledge and
experience about past and current events and assumptions about future
events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because
of their significance to the financial statements and because of the
possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly
from those expected.

The most sensitive estimate affecting the Plan's financial statements
relates to:

[Include applicable items:]

- Fair value of investments - Investment valuations were provided by
  the Plan's custodian and are based on quoted market prices, net asset
  values, or other appropriate valuation methodologies for the types
  of investments held.

- [For stable value funds:] Contract value of fully benefit-responsive
  investment contracts - The Plan holds investments in stable value
  funds that are reported at contract value. Fair value of these
  investments was $[AMOUNT] compared to contract value of $[AMOUNT].

- [For employer securities - closely held:] Fair value of employer
  securities - The Plan holds [NUMBER] shares of employer stock valued
  at $[AMOUNT] based on an independent appraisal dated [DATE].

We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop these
estimates and determined that they are reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole.

Financial Statement Disclosures

The financial statement disclosures are neutral, consistent, and clear.

DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN PERFORMING THE AUDIT
------------------------------------------------

[Choose one:]

[If no difficulties:]
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management
in performing and completing our audit.

[If difficulties encountered:]
We encountered the following difficulties during our audit:
- [Describe difficulties, such as delays in receiving information,
  unavailability of personnel, etc.]

## INTERNAL CONTROL MATTERS

### When No Deficiencies Identified

```
INTERNAL CONTROL MATTERS
------------------------

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we
considered the Plan's internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Plan's internal control. Accordingly, we do not
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan's internal control.

We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider
to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.
```

### When Deficiencies Identified

```
INTERNAL CONTROL MATTERS
------------------------

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we
considered the Plan's internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Plan's internal control. Accordingly, we do not
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of
a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course
of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct,
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected,
on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material
weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with
governance.

[MATERIAL WEAKNESS - if applicable:]

We identified the following deficiency in internal control that we
consider to be a material weakness:

[DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESS]
[Describe the deficiency, the potential effect, and recommendations]

[SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY - if applicable:]

We identified the following deficiency in internal control that we
consider to be a significant deficiency:

[DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY]
[Describe the deficiency, the potential effect, and recommendations]

[OTHER DEFICIENCIES - if applicable:]

We also identified the following deficiencies in internal control that
we do not consider to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies:

[DESCRIPTION OF OTHER DEFICIENCIES]
[Describe each deficiency and recommendations]

## Common Internal Control Findings for 401(k) Plans

### Late Remittance of Participant Contributions

```
FINDING: LATE REMITTANCE OF PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTIONS

Condition: During our testing, we identified [NUMBER] instances where
participant contributions were not remitted to the trust within the
time frame required by Department of Labor regulations.

Criteria: DOL regulations require that participant contributions be
remitted to the trust as soon as they can reasonably be segregated
from the employer's general assets, but no later than the 15th business
day of the month following the month in which the contributions were
withheld. For smaller plans, the DOL has established a 7-business day
safe harbor.

Cause: [Describe cause - e.g., payroll processing delays, manual
processes, lack of monitoring, etc.]

Effect: Late remittance of participant contributions constitutes a
prohibited transaction under ERISA Section 406(a)(1)(D) and IRC
Section 4975(c)(1)(D), requiring correction under DOL regulations.
Total late contributions identified: $[AMOUNT]. Lost earnings
calculated: $[AMOUNT].

Recommendation: We recommend that the Plan implement procedures to
ensure participant contributions are remitted within [1-3] business
days of payroll. Additionally, we recommend the Plan Sponsor correct
the late contributions through the DOL's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction
Program.

Management Response: [Include management's response and corrective
action plan]
```

### Inadequate Segregation of Duties

```
FINDING: INADEQUATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES

Condition: During our review of internal controls, we noted that the
[POSITION/INDIVIDUAL] has the ability to [describe incompatible duties
- e.g., initiate contribution remittances, approve distributions, and
reconcile the trust account].

Criteria: Effective internal control includes the segregation of
incompatible duties such that no single individual can initiate,
authorize, and record transactions without independent review.

Cause: Limited staff resources and organizational structure.

Effect: The concentration of duties increases the risk that errors or
fraud may occur and not be detected in a timely manner.

Recommendation: We recommend that the Plan implement compensating
controls, such as:
- Independent review and approval of all transactions by a second
  individual
- Periodic reconciliations performed by someone independent of the
  transaction processing
- Regular review of activity reports by management

Management Response: [Include management's response]
```

### Lack of Timely Reconciliation

```
FINDING: LACK OF TIMELY RECONCILIATION

Condition: Reconciliations between the trust account, recordkeeper
reports, and the general ledger were not performed on a timely basis.

Criteria: Effective internal control includes regular reconciliation
of accounts to identify and resolve discrepancies promptly.

Cause: [Describe cause]

Effect: Errors or irregularities may not be identified in a timely
manner, increasing the risk of material misstatement.

Recommendation: We recommend that the Plan implement monthly
reconciliations with documented review and approval.

Management Response: [Include management's response]
```

## Additional Required Communications

```
CORRECTED AND UNCORRECTED MISSTATEMENTS
---------------------------------------

Professional standards require us to accumulate all misstatements
identified during the audit, other than those that are clearly trivial,
and communicate them to the appropriate level of management.

[Choose one:]

[If no misstatements:]
We did not identify any misstatements as a result of our audit procedures.

[If corrected misstatements:]
The following misstatements were detected during the audit and corrected
by management:

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| [Description] | $[AMOUNT] |
| [Description] | $[AMOUNT] |

[If uncorrected misstatements:]
The following misstatements were detected during the audit and, in our
judgment, are immaterial both individually and in the aggregate to the
financial statements taken as a whole. Management has determined that
correcting these misstatements is not necessary.

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| [Description] | $[AMOUNT] |
| [Description] | $[AMOUNT] |

DISAGREEMENTS WITH MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------

MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIONS
--------------------------

We have requested certain representations from management that are
included in the management representation letter dated [DATE].

MANAGEMENT CONSULTATIONS WITH OTHER INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a "second
opinion" on certain situations.

[Choose one:]

[If no consultations:]
To our knowledge, management has not consulted with other accountants
regarding auditing or accounting matters.

[If consultations occurred:]
We are aware that management consulted with [FIRM NAME] regarding
[MATTER]. We have reviewed the consultation and [agree/disagree] with

OTHER AUDIT FINDINGS OR ISSUES
------------------------------

We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application
of accounting principles and auditing standards, with management each
year prior to retention as the Plan's auditors. However, these
discussions occurred in the normal course of our professional
relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention.

OTHER MATTERS
-------------

[Include any other matters the auditor considers relevant, such as:]

- Regulatory changes affecting the Plan (e.g., SECURE 2.0 Act)
- Upcoming compliance requirements
- Industry trends or best practices
