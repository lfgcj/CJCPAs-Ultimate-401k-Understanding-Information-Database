## How 401(k) Plans Work

### Contribution Flow

```
Employee's Paycheck
        ↓
Pre-Tax or Roth Election
        ↓
Deducted from Paycheck
        ↓
Deposited into 401(k) Account
        ↓
Invested per Participant Direction
        ↓
Grows Tax-Deferred (or Tax-Free for Roth)
        ↓
Available at Retirement (usually 59½)
```

### Participant Account Structure

Each participant has an individual account that may include:

1. **Employee Deferral Account**
   - Pre-tax contributions
   - Subject to annual limits
   - Immediately 100% vested

2. **Roth Deferral Account**
   - After-tax contributions
   - Subject to same limits as pre-tax
   - Tax-free growth and distribution

3. **Employer Match Account**
   - Employer matching contributions
   - May be subject to vesting schedule
   - Various match formulas possible

4. **Profit Sharing Account**
   - Discretionary employer contributions
   - Usually subject to vesting
   - Based on company profits or flat contribution

5. **Rollover Account**
   - Transferred from prior plans or IRAs
   - Always 100% vested
   - Maintains tax-advantaged status

6. **After-Tax Account**
   - Non-Roth after-tax contributions
   - May be allowed under plan
   - Enables "mega backdoor Roth" strategy

### Investment Process

1. **Plan offers investment menu** - Selected by plan fiduciaries
2. **Participant selects investments** - From available options
3. **Contributions allocated** - According to participant elections
4. **Periodic rebalancing** - May be automatic or manual
5. **Performance tracked** - Daily valuation typical
6. **Statements provided** - At least quarterly

## Tax Advantages

### For Employees

#### Traditional (Pre-Tax) Contributions
- **Immediate Tax Reduction**: Contributions reduce current taxable income
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: No taxes on investment gains until withdrawal

#### Roth Contributions
- **Tax-Free Growth**: Investment gains are never taxed
- **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Qualified distributions are completely tax-free
- **No RMDs**: After SECURE 2.0, Roth 401(k) not subject to RMDs during owner's lifetime
- **Hedge Against Future Tax Increases**: Beneficial if tax rates rise

### For Employers

- **Tax Deduction**: Employer contributions are deductible business expenses
- **FICA Savings**: Employer portion of FICA not owed on deferrals
- **Recruitment Tool**: Competitive benefit attracts talent
