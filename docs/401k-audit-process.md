Materiality Percentage: 1%
Planning Materiality: $500,000
Performance Materiality: $375,000 (75%)
Trivial Threshold: $25,000 (5%)
```

#### Factors Affecting Materiality

- Type of plan
- Number of participants
- Risk characteristics
- User expectations

### Audit Plan Development

#### Scope Decisions

- Limited vs full scope
- Testing approaches
- Sample sizes
- Timing of procedures
- Staff assignments

#### Document Requests

Prepare initial document request list:
- Trust statements
- Contribution records
- Census data
- Distribution documentation
- Loan records
- Meeting minutes
- Testing results

## Analytical Procedures

### Required Analytical Procedures

#### Planning Analytics

Compare current to prior year:
- Net assets
- Contributions by type
- Distributions
- Investment income
- Participant counts

#### Substantive Analytics

| Analysis | Expected Relationship |
|----------|----------------------|
| Deferrals to compensation | Should be consistent rate |
| Match to deferrals | Should follow formula |
| Distributions to terminations | Should correlate |
| Investment return to market | Should be reasonable |

#### Final Analytics

Review overall financial statements:
- Are changes explained?
- Is relationship to economy reasonable?
- Are ratios consistent?

### Common Analytical Tests

**Contribution Reasonableness:**
```
Average salary: $75,000
Participants: 500
Average deferral rate: 6%
Expected deferrals: $75,000 × 500 × 6% = $2,250,000
Actual deferrals: $2,300,000
Variance: $50,000 (2.2%) - reasonable
```

**Investment Return Analysis:**
```
Beginning net assets: $45,000,000
Market return: 12%
Expected investment income: $5,400,000
Actual investment income: $5,200,000
Variance: $200,000 - investigate
```
