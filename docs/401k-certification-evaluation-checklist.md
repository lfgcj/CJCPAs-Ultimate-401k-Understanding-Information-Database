## Overview of Certification Requirements

### Legal Authority

Under ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), a plan administrator may elect to have the annual audit exclude information:

> "...prepared and certified by a bank or similar institution or by an insurance carrier which is regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a State or Federal agency..."

### DOL Regulations

29 CFR 2520.103-8 provides detailed requirements:
- Specifies who may certify
- Specifies what must be certified
- Specifies the form of certification
- Establishes auditor responsibilities

### Key Principle

**The certification transfers responsibility for investment information from the auditor to the certifying institution.** However, the auditor must:
- Verify the certification is valid
- Verify the certifying institution qualifies
- Verify the certification covers required information
- Reconcile certified amounts to financial statements
- Test any non-certified items fully
