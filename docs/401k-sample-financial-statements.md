## Limited Scope Auditor's Report

### Independent Auditor's Report (SAS 136 Format)

```
                    INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Plan Administrator and Plan Participants
ABC Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan

Scope and Nature of the ERISA-Permitted Limited Scope Audit

We have performed a limited scope audit of the financial statements of
the ABC Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan"), which
comprise the statements of net assets available for benefits as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of changes in
net assets available for benefits for the years then ended, and the
related notes to the financial statements.

An ERISA-permitted limited scope audit of such financial statements
comprises performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAS). The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to
the Plan's preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances.

As permitted by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's Rules
and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the plan administrator
instructed us not to perform, and we did not perform, any auditing
procedures with respect to the information summarized in Note 4,
which was certified by XYZ Bank, N.A., the custodian of the Plan,
except for comparing such information with the related financial
statements and supplemental schedules. We have been informed by
the plan administrator that the custodian is a bank regulated and
supervised by a federal agency and that the certification required
by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 has been received.

The form and content of the information included in the financial
statements and supplemental schedules, other than that derived from
the certified investment information, have been audited by us in
accordance with GAAS and, in our opinion, are presented in compliance
with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting
and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974.

Responsibilities of Plan Management and Those Charged with
Governance for the Financial Statements

Plan management is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of these financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance
of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

Plan management is also responsible for maintaining a current plan
instrument, administering the Plan, and determining that the Plan's
transactions that are presented and disclosed in the financial
statements are in conformity with the Plan's provisions.

Disclaimer of Opinion on the Financial Statements

Because of the significance of the matter described in the Scope and
Nature of the ERISA-Permitted Limited Scope Audit section of our
report, we have not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence
to provide a basis for an audit opinion. Accordingly, we do not
express an opinion on these financial statements.

Report on Supplemental Schedules

The supplemental schedules of assets (held at end of year) as of
December 31, 2024 and delinquent participant contributions for the
year ended December 31, 2024 (supplemental schedules) are required
by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting
and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 and are presented for the purpose of additional analysis.
The supplemental schedules are the responsibility of plan management.
The supplemental schedules were derived from and relate directly
to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
financial statements. The supplemental schedules have been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in our limited scope audit of the
financial statements. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial
statements as a whole.

Directors. XYZ Retirement Services, Inc. serves as the recordkeeper
and XYZ Bank, N.A. serves as the trustee and custodian.

Contributions

Participants may contribute up to 75% of their eligible compensation
on a pre-tax or Roth after-tax basis, subject to Internal Revenue
Code ("IRC") limitations. The IRC limit for participant contributions
was $23,000 for 2024. Participants who have attained age 50 may
make additional catch-up contributions of $7,500 for 2024.

The Company provides a matching contribution equal to 100% of the
first 3% of eligible compensation deferred and 50% of the next 2%
of eligible compensation deferred. The Company may also make
discretionary profit-sharing contributions.

Participants may also rollover amounts representing distributions
from other qualified retirement plans or individual retirement
accounts.

Participant Accounts

Each participant's account is credited with the participant's
contributions, employer contributions, and an allocation of Plan
earnings. The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the
benefit that can be provided from the participant's vested account.

Vesting

Participants are immediately vested in their contributions plus
actual earnings thereon. Employer matching contributions vest
according to the following schedule:

     Years of Service    Vested Percentage
     ----------------    -----------------
     Less than 2 years          0%
     2 years                   20%
     3 years                   40%
     4 years                   60%
     5 years                   80%
     6 years or more          100%

Employer profit-sharing contributions vest according to the same
schedule. Forfeited balances of terminated participants are used
to reduce future employer contributions or pay Plan expenses.
Forfeitures used during 2024 totaled $78,456.

Notes Receivable from Participants

Participants may borrow from their accounts a minimum of $1,000
up to a maximum equal to the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of their
vested account balance. Loan terms range from one to five years
or up to fifteen years for the purchase of a primary residence.
The loans are secured by the balance in the participant's account
and bear interest at a rate commensurate with local prevailing
rates as determined by the Committee. Principal and interest are
paid through payroll deductions.

Payment of Benefits

Upon termination of service due to death, disability, retirement,
or other termination of employment, a participant may elect to
receive a lump-sum distribution equal to the vested value of his
or her account, or in the case of account balances greater than
$5,000, may elect to defer distribution. Hardship withdrawals
and in-service withdrawals at age 59½ are also permitted.

Plan Termination

Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has
the right under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any
time and to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.
In the event of Plan termination, participants would become 100%
vested in their accounts.


NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Accounting

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the
accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of net assets available for benefits
and changes therein. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Investment Valuation and Income Recognition

Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value is the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. See Note 5 for discussion of fair value
measurements.

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date
basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends
are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation includes
the Plan's gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well
as held during the year.

Notes Receivable from Participants

Notes receivable from participants are measured at their unpaid
principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest. Interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis. Related fees are recorded
as administrative expenses when incurred. No allowance for credit
losses has been recorded as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.

If a participant ceases to make loan repayments and the plan
administrator deems the participant loan to be in default, the
participant loan balance is reduced and a benefit payment is
recorded.

Payment of Benefits

Benefits are recorded when paid.

Administrative Expenses

Certain administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company
and are not reflected in the financial statements. Fees related to
the administration of notes receivable from participants are charged
directly to the participant's account and are reflected as administrative
expenses in the accompanying financial statements.


NOTE 3 - TAX STATUS

The Plan has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") dated March 15, 2022, stating that the Plan
is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
"Code") and, therefore, the related trust is exempt from taxation.
Subsequent to this determination by the IRS, the Plan was amended.
Once qualified, the Plan is required to operate in conformity with
the Code to maintain its qualification. The Committee believes the
Plan is being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements
of the Code and, therefore, believes that the Plan, as amended, is
qualified and the related trust is tax-exempt.

U.S. GAAP requires plan management to evaluate uncertain tax positions
taken by the Plan. The financial statement effects of a tax position
are recognized when the position is more likely than not, based on
the technical merits, to be sustained upon examination by the IRS.
The Committee has analyzed the tax positions taken by the Plan and
has concluded that as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there are no
uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken. The Plan has
recognized no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however,
there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress.


NOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS

The Plan's investments are held by XYZ Bank, N.A., the Plan's
custodian. Pursuant to the limited scope audit requirements of
29 CFR 2520.103-8, the Plan administrator has elected to limit
the scope of the annual audit, and the auditor's procedures with
respect to the following information certified by the custodian
were limited to comparing this information with the related
financial statements.

The following presents investments that represent 5% or more of
the Plan's net assets as of December 31:

on investments bought and sold, as well as held during the year)
appreciated in value as follows:

                                              2024

NOTE 5 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:

  Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted
            quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
            in active markets that the Plan has the ability to
            access.

  Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
            - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
              in active markets;
            - Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
              liabilities in inactive markets;
            - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
              for the asset or liability; and
            - Inputs that are derived principally from or
              corroborated by observable market data by
              correlation or other means.

  Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
            and significant to the fair value measurement.

The asset's or liability's fair value measurement level within the
fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques
maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
assets measured at fair value:

Mutual Funds: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the
fund. Mutual funds held by the Plan are open-end mutual funds that
are registered with the SEC. These funds are required to publish
their daily net asset value (NAV) and to transact at that price.
Mutual funds are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Employer Securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the
active market on which the individual securities are traded.
Classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Common Collective Trusts: Valued based on the NAV of units of a
bank collective trust. The NAV, as provided by the trustee, is used
as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is based on
the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less
its liabilities. This practical expedient is not used when it is
determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for
an amount different than the reported NAV. Participant transactions
(purchases and sales) may occur daily.

Stable Value Fund: The XYZ Stable Value Fund is a common collective
trust that invests in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts
issued by insurance companies and other financial institutions. The
fund is valued using the NAV practical expedient. Participant
transactions may occur daily without restriction.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation
that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective
of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Plan believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions
to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value
hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of December 31, 2024:

                              Level 1      Level 2      Level 3      Total

NOTE 6 - PARTY-IN-INTEREST TRANSACTIONS

Certain Plan investments are managed by XYZ Bank, N.A., the trustee
as defined by the Plan. Additionally, the Plan holds common stock of
ABC Company, the Plan Sponsor. These transactions qualify as exempt
party-in-interest transactions. Fees paid by the Plan for investment
management services were included as a reduction of the return earned
on each fund.


NOTE 7 - RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The Plan invests in various investment securities. Investment
securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate,
market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated
with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably
possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially
affect participants' account balances and the amounts reported in
the statements of net assets available for benefits.

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Plan has evaluated subsequent events through [Date of Auditor's
Report], the date the financial statements were available to be
issued, and has determined there are no subsequent events that
require disclosure.

[If applicable, disclose any significant subsequent events such as:]
- Significant market declines
- Plan amendments
- Plan termination
- Regulatory changes
- Significant changes in participation


NOTE 10 - EXEMPT PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS

[Include if late deposits occurred:]

The Plan identified instances during the plan year in which
participant contributions were not deposited to the trust within
the time frame specified by DOL regulations. The Plan corrected
these prohibited transactions under the Department of Labor's
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program and contributed lost
earnings of $2,345 to affected participant accounts during 2024.
