### Direct Rollover (Trustee-to-Trustee)

Funds transferred directly between plan trustees/custodians:

## Special Considerations

### Roth Conversions

Converting pre-tax to Roth:
- Taxable event
- No 10% penalty on conversion
- 5-year rule for earnings
- Can convert from 401(k) to Roth IRA
- Can convert within plan (if allowed)

### After-Tax Contributions

After-tax (non-Roth) contributions can be:
- Rolled to traditional IRA (basis tracked)
- Converted to Roth IRA (tax-free on basis)
- Split between IRA and Roth (careful allocation)

### Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

Special rule for employer stock:
- NUA taxed as capital gain when sold
- Basis taxed as ordinary income at distribution
- Must take lump sum distribution
- Cannot roll over for NUA treatment

### Inherited Retirement Accounts

| Situation | Rollover Rules |
|-----------|----------------|
| Spouse inherits | Can roll to own IRA or inherited |
| Non-spouse inherits | Cannot roll to own IRA (post-SECURE Act) |
| Trust inherits | Generally cannot roll over |
| Estate inherits | Generally cannot roll over |

### Required Beginning Date Considerations

If participant has reached RMD age:
- RMD for current year cannot be rolled over
- Must take RMD first, then roll over rest
- Applies to receiving plan as well
