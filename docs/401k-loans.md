## IRC Section 72(p) Requirements

### Maximum Loan Amount

The lesser of:
1. **$50,000** reduced by highest outstanding loan balance in prior 12 months, OR
2. **50% of vested account balance**

### Maximum Amount Examples

**Example 1: Standard Calculation**
```
Vested balance: $100,000
50% of vested: $50,000
$50,000 limit: $50,000
Maximum: $50,000

If highest balance in prior 12 months was $10,000:
Maximum = $50,000 - $10,000 = $40,000
```

**Example 2: Small Balance**
```
Vested balance: $40,000
50% of vested: $20,000
$50,000 limit: $50,000
Maximum: $20,000 (lesser amount)
```

### $10,000 Floor

## Loan Defaults and Deemed Distributions

### When Default Occurs

Default typically when:
- Payment missed after cure period
- Employment terminates (per plan terms)
- Plan terms violated

### Cure Period

Plans typically provide:
- Grace period after missed payment
- Common: end of quarter following missed payment
- Varies by plan document

### Deemed Distribution

When loan defaults:
- Outstanding balance treated as distribution
- Taxable as ordinary income
- 10% penalty if under 59½
- Cannot roll over
- Reported on Form 1099-R

### Deemed Distribution Example

```
Loan balance at default: $15,000
Participant age: 45
Tax bracket: 24%

Tax consequences:
- Income tax: $15,000 × 24% = $3,600
- 10% penalty: $15,000 × 10% = $1,500
- Total tax cost: $5,100

Participant still owes loan to plan
(loan is not forgiven)
```

### Loan Offset

If distribution occurs (termination, plan termination):
- Loan offset against account balance
- Taxable distribution
- Can roll over within 60 days
- Includes to tax filing deadline + extensions (TCJA)

## Audit Considerations

- Deemed distributions

### Common Audit Findings

| Finding | Issue |
|---------|-------|

| Exceeds $50,000 | Over IRC limit |
| Term > 5 years | Repayment too long |
| Missed payments | Potential deemed distribution |
| Missing documentation | No promissory note |
| Improper interest | Rate not reasonable |
