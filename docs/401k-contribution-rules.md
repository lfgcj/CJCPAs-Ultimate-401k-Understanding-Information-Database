   - After-tax contributions
   - No current tax benefit
   - Tax-free qualified withdrawals

3. **After-Tax Contributions**
   - Non-Roth after-tax
   - Contributions taxed, earnings tax-deferred
   - Enables "mega backdoor Roth"

### Employer Contributions

1. **Matching Contributions**
   - Based on employee deferrals
   - Formula specified in plan document
   - May be discretionary or mandatory

2. **Non-Elective (Profit Sharing)**
   - Not dependent on employee deferrals
   - May be discretionary or fixed

## Employee Deferrals

### 402(g) Limit

The basic limit on elective deferrals:

- **2024 Limit**: $23,000
- **Applies to**: Pre-tax + Roth combined
- **Per Individual**: Not per plan

### Pre-Tax Deferrals

#### How They Work
```
Gross Salary:                    $100,000
Pre-Tax 401(k) Deferral:        -$23,000
Taxable Income (W-2 Box 1):      $77,000
```

#### Tax Impact Example (24% bracket)
- $23,000 deferral × 24% = $5,520 tax savings
- Plus tax-deferred growth over time

### Roth Deferrals

#### How They Work
```
Gross Salary:                    $100,000
Roth 401(k) Deferral:           -$23,000
Taxable Income (W-2 Box 1):      $100,000 (no reduction)
But: Tax-free at withdrawal
```

### Combining Pre-Tax and Roth

- Combined limit: $23,000 (2024)
- Can split any way between pre-tax and Roth
- Examples:
  - $23,000 pre-tax, $0 Roth
  - $15,000 pre-tax, $8,000 Roth
  - $0 pre-tax, $23,000 Roth

### After-Tax (Non-Roth) Contributions

- **Not counted** against 402(g) limit
- **Is counted** against 415(c) annual additions
- Subject to ACP testing
- Enables "mega backdoor Roth" conversions

---

## Catch-Up Contributions

### Age 50+ Catch-Up

Additional contributions for participants turning 50 or older during the year:

| Year | Standard Catch-Up |
|------|------------------|
| 2024 | $7,500 |
| 2025 | $7,500 (projected) |

### SECURE 2.0 Enhanced Catch-Up (Starting 2025)

For participants ages 60-63:
- **Higher catch-up**: $10,000 or 150% of standard (whichever greater)
- **Indexed for inflation**
- Only for ages 60, 61, 62, and 63

### Catch-Up Eligibility

- Must turn 50 (or 60-63 for enhanced) by December 31
- Only after reaching regular deferral limit
- Available regardless of compensation level

### Catch-Up Contribution Example

```
Participant Age 55, Salary $150,000

Regular Deferral Limit:          $23,000
Catch-Up Contribution:           +$7,500
Total Possible Deferrals:        $30,500
```

### Roth Catch-Up Requirement (2026+)

- HCEs earning $145,000+ must make catch-ups as Roth
- Cannot choose pre-tax for catch-up
- Applies to catch-up only, not regular deferrals

---

## Employer Contributions

### Matching Contributions

#### Common Match Formulas

| Type | Formula | Maximum Match |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Dollar-for-Dollar | 100% up to 6% | 6% |
| 50% Match | 50% up to 6% | 3% |
| Tiered | 100% on 3%, 50% on next 2% | 4% |
| Safe Harbor | 100% on 3%, 50% on next 2% | 4% |
| QACA | 100% on 1%, 50% on next 5% | 3.5% |

#### True-Up Provisions

Many plans include "true-up" to ensure participants receive full match:

**Without True-Up:**
```
Employee maxes out deferrals by September
No more deferrals October-December
Loses match on October-December paychecks
```

**With True-Up:**
```
Plan calculates total match based on annual compensation
Compares to match actually made
Deposits difference as "true-up" contribution
```

### Profit Sharing Contributions

#### Allocation Methods

1. **Pro-Rata**
   - Same percentage for all participants
   - Based on compensation
   - Simplest method

2. **New Comparability (Cross-Tested)**
   - Different rates for different groups
   - Often favors owners/HCEs
   - Must pass nondiscrimination tests

3. **Age-Weighted**
   - Higher percentage for older participants
   - Based on actuarial factors
   - Benefits those closer to retirement

4. **Integrated with Social Security**
   - Higher rate on compensation above Social Security wage base
   - Recognizes SS provides base level benefit
   - Also called "permitted disparity"

### Forfeiture Usage

Non-vested amounts from terminated participants can be:
- Used to reduce employer contributions
- Used to pay plan expenses
- Reallocated to remaining participants
- Must be used per plan document

---

## Annual Additions Limit

### IRC Section 415(c) Limit

The total amount that can be contributed to a participant's account annually:

**2024 Limit: $69,000** (excluding catch-up)

### What Counts Toward 415(c)

| Included | Not Included |
|----------|--------------|
| Employee pre-tax deferrals | Catch-up contributions |
| Employee Roth deferrals | Rollovers |
| Employee after-tax contributions | Loan repayments |
| Employer matching | Restorative payments |
| Employer profit sharing | |
| Forfeitures allocated | |

### Limitation Year

- Usually the plan year
- But can be designated differently
- 415 limit prorated for short limitation years

### Maximizing Contributions Example

```
Participant Age 55, Salary $400,000

Standard Deferral:               $23,000
Employer Match (3%):             $10,350 (limited to $345,000 comp)
Employer Profit Sharing:         $35,650
Subtotal (415 limit):            $69,000

Plus Catch-Up:                   +$7,500
Total Contributions:             $76,500
```

---

## Compensation Limits

### IRC Section 401(a)(17) Limit

Only compensation up to a limit can be considered for contributions:

**2024 Limit: $345,000**

### Impact on Contributions

```
Employee Salary: $500,000
Compensation Limit: $345,000

3% Match Calculation:
Actual: $500,000 × 3% = $15,000
Limited to: $345,000 × 3% = $10,350
```

### Definition of Compensation

Plans can use various definitions:
- W-2 wages
- Section 3401(a) wages
- 415 safe harbor compensation
- Simplified compensation (IRC 414(s))

Must include (depending on definition):
- Salary/wages
- Overtime
- Bonuses
- Commissions
- Usually: elective deferrals, cafeteria plan reductions

May exclude:
- Fringe benefits
- Reimbursements
- Moving expenses
- Deferred compensation distributions

---

## Highly Compensated Employee Rules

### HCE Definition

An employee is highly compensated if:

1. **5% Owner**: Any time during current or prior year, OR
2. **Prior Year Compensation**: Earned more than threshold ($155,000 for 2024 based on 2023 earnings)

### Top-Paid Group Election

Employer may elect to limit HCEs to top 20% of employees by compensation. This can reduce testing burden.

### HCE Impact on Testing

HCEs vs NHCEs comparison for:
- ADP test (deferrals)
- ACP test (matching/after-tax)
- Coverage tests

### Key Employee Definition (Different from HCE)

Key employees for top-heavy testing:
- Officers earning > $220,000 (2024)
- 5% owners
- 1% owners earning > $150,000

---

## Multiple Plan Rules

### Aggregation of Deferrals

The 402(g) limit applies across ALL plans:

```
Job 1 - Traditional 401(k):      $15,000
Job 2 - 403(b):                  $10,000
Total:                           $25,000
Limit:                           $23,000
EXCESS:                          $2,000 (must be corrected)
```

### 415 Controlled Group Rules

For 415 limit, aggregate contributions from:
- All plans of same employer
- Plans of controlled group members
- Plans of affiliated service groups

### Same Employer, Multiple Plans

If employer sponsors multiple plans:
- 415 limit applies across all plans combined
- But deferrals to each 401(k) plan have individual 402(g) limit

---

## Contribution Timing

### Employee Deferrals

#### DOL Timing Rule

Deferrals must be deposited as soon as reasonably possible:

| Plan Size | Deadline |
|-----------|----------|
| Large plans (100+ participants) | As soon as practicable, but no later than 15th business day of following month |
| Small plans (<100) | Safe harbor: 7 business days after payroll |

#### Best Practice
- Same day as payroll or next business day
- Consistent timing avoids scrutiny
- Document delays and reasons

### Employer Contributions

| Contribution Type | Deadline |
|------------------|----------|
| Matching Contributions | Tax filing deadline + extensions |
| Profit Sharing | Tax filing deadline + extensions |
| Safe Harbor | Within 12 months of plan year end (for prior year) |
| QNEC/QMAC | End of following plan year (for corrective) |

### Late Contributions

Late employee deferrals:
- Lost earnings must be calculated and contributed
- Reported on Form 5500
- May require VFCP filing
- Can result in penalties

---

## Excess Contributions

### Types of Excess Contributions

1. **Excess Deferrals (402(g))**
   - Exceeding annual deferral limit
   - Must be distributed by April 15

2. **Excess Contributions (ADP)**
   - HCE deferrals exceeding ADP limit
   - Correct by refund, QNEC, or recharacterization

3. **Excess Aggregate Contributions (ACP)**
   - HCE matching exceeding ACP limit
   - Correct by refund or QMAC

4. **Excess Annual Additions (415)**

#### ADP/ACP Failures

| Correction | Deadline | Method |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Refunds | 2½ months | Distribute excess to HCEs |
| Extended | 12 months | Distribute but 10% excise tax |
| QNEC/QMAC | 12 months | Contribute to NHCEs |

---

## Special Situations

### Mid-Year Plan Entry

- Full 402(g) limit available regardless of entry date
- 415 limit not prorated for participant's short year
- But compensation only counted while participating

### Part-Time Employees

- Same 402(g) limit applies
- 415 limit may be less if compensation lower
- May be excluded from testing if under hours threshold

### Multiple Employer Controlled Groups

- Each employer in controlled group treated as one
- Combined 415 limits
- Aggregated testing (generally)
- Single plan covering multiple entities

### Plan Year vs Calendar Year

- 402(g) is always calendar year
- 415 is limitation year (usually plan year)
- This can create complexity for fiscal year plans

---

## Strategies for Maximizing Contributions

### For Participants

1. **At Minimum**: Contribute enough to get full employer match
2. **Standard Goal**: Max out 402(g) limit ($23,000)
3. **Age 50+**: Add catch-up contribution ($7,500)
4. **Mega Backdoor**: After-tax contributions if plan allows

### For Business Owners

1. Safe Harbor plan enables maximum deferrals
2. Profit sharing adds employer contribution
3. Age-weighted or new comparability may favor owners
4. Cash balance plan can be paired for even more

### Mega Backdoor Roth Strategy

If plan allows after-tax contributions and in-service conversions:

```
Pre-Tax or Roth Deferral:        $23,000
Employer Contributions:          $10,000
After-Tax Contributions:         $36,000
Total:                           $69,000 (415 limit)

Convert after-tax to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA
Result: Up to $69,000 in Roth accounts annually
```
