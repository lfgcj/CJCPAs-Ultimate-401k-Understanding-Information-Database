## Overview of MEPs and PEPs

### What Are Multiple Employer Plans?

Multiple Employer Plans (MEPs) are retirement plans that cover employees of two or more unrelated employers. Unlike single employer plans, MEPs allow multiple businesses to participate in a single plan, potentially reducing costs and administrative burdens.

### What Are Pooled Employer Plans?

Pooled Employer Plans (PEPs) are a specific type of MEP created by the SECURE Act of 2019. PEPs are administered by a Pooled Plan Provider (PPP) and allow unrelated employers to participate in a single plan without requiring a common connection or "nexus."

### Key Differences

| Feature | Traditional MEP | Association MEP | PEP |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----|
| Common nexus required | Yes | Yes (same industry/geography) | No |
| One bad apple rule | Applies | Applies | Does not apply |
| Pooled Plan Provider | Not required | Not required | Required |
| Available since | Pre-SECURE | 2019 (DOL rule) | 2021 (SECURE Act) |
| Audit requirement | Plan-level | Plan-level | Plan-level |
| Form 5500 filing | Single filing | Single filing | Single filing |

### Historical Context

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| Pre-2019 | Traditional MEPs required common ownership or affiliation |
| 2019 | DOL issued rule allowing "Association Retirement Plans" (ARPs) |
| 2019 | SECURE Act created PEPs |
| 2021 | PEPs became available (January 1) |
| 2022 | SECURE 2.0 expanded and clarified PEP rules |

---

## Types of Multiple Employer Arrangements

### 1. Traditional Multiple Employer Plans

**Definition:** Plans covering employees of two or more employers that have some common ownership or control.

**Characteristics:**
- Common ownership (e.g., controlled group, affiliated service group)
- Single plan document
- Single trust
- Unified administration
- Subject to "one bad apple" rule

**Example:** A parent company sponsors a 401(k) that covers employees of multiple subsidiaries.

### 2. Association Retirement Plans (ARPs)

**Definition:** MEPs sponsored by bona fide employer groups or associations.

**Requirements:**
- Association must be a bona fide organization
- Employers must share a common interest (industry, geography)
- Employers must exercise control over the plan
- Association's primary purpose cannot be offering benefits

**Examples:**
- Industry trade association plan (construction industry association)
- Geographic chamber of commerce plan
- Professional association plan (medical practices)

### 3. Pooled Employer Plans (PEPs)

**Definition:** Defined contribution plans established and maintained by a Pooled Plan Provider that allows unrelated employers to participate.

**Key Requirements:**
- Must be administered by a registered PPP
- PPP must be named fiduciary
- PPP must register with DOL
- No common nexus required between employers
- "One bad apple" rule does not apply

**Structure:**

```

### 4. Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Plans

**Definition:** Plans maintained by PEOs for worksite employees of client companies.

**Considerations:**
- Co-employment relationship
- May or may not qualify as MEP
- Special DOL guidance applies
- Not the same as a PEP

---

## Regulatory Framework

### ERISA Requirements

| Requirement | MEP | PEP |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| ERISA coverage | Yes | Yes |
| Fiduciary duties | Apply | Apply (PPP is named fiduciary) |
| Reporting (Form 5500) | Single plan filing | Single plan filing |
| Audit requirement | Same as single employer | Same as single employer |
| Bonding | Required | Required |
| Prohibited transactions | Apply | Apply |

### IRC Requirements

| Requirement | MEP | PEP |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| Qualification under 401(a) | Required | Required |
| Nondiscrimination testing | Plan-wide (some per-employer) | Plan-wide with PPP flexibility |
| 415 limits | Per employer | Per employer |
| ADP/ACP testing | Generally plan-wide | Can be per employer |
| Coverage testing | Per employer | Per employer |

### DOL Guidance

**Key DOL Guidance:**
- 29 CFR 2510.3-55: Definition of employer for MEP purposes
- Field Assistance Bulletin 2019-01: Association Retirement Plans
- 29 CFR 2510.3-44: Registration requirements for PPPs

### One Bad Apple Rule

**Traditional Rule (MEPs):**
If one participating employer fails to satisfy qualification requirements, the entire plan could be disqualified.

**PEP Exception:**
Under SECURE Act Section 101, if one employer fails to take corrective action for a compliance failure:
- The PPP can spin off that employer's portion
- Other employers are not affected
- The non-compliant employer becomes responsible for their own plan

---

## Audit Requirements

### When Is an Audit Required?

The audit requirement for MEPs and PEPs follows the same rules as single employer plans:

| Plan Size | Audit Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Under 100 participants with balances | Exempt (small plan) |
| 100-120 participants with balances | 80-120 rule may apply |
| Over 120 participants with balances | Audit required |

**Important:** The participant count is for the entire MEP/PEP, not per employer.

**2023 Rule Change:** Effective for plan years beginning January 1, 2023, count only participants **with account balances**, not all "eligible" participants.

### Counting Participants

For MEPs and PEPs, count all participants **with account balances** across all participating employers:

```
Employer A participants with balances:    45
Employer B participants with balances:    35
Employer C participants with balances:    55
                                        -----
Total participants with balances:        135 → Audit required
```

### 100/120 Rule Application

The number "80" is irrelevant. Only two thresholds matter: **100** and **120**.

| If Last Year Was: | And This Year Participants Are: | Audit Requirement |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Large plan (audit) | 100 or more | Continue audit |
| Large plan (audit) | Under 100 | May elect small plan (no audit) |
| Small plan (no audit) | Under 121 | Continue small plan (no audit) |
| Small plan (no audit) | 121 or more | Audit required |

**Key thresholds:**
- **100** = Point where large plans can drop to small
- **121** = Point where small plans must become large

### Limited Scope vs. Full Scope

MEPs and PEPs can elect limited scope audits if:
- A qualifying institution holds the assets
- A proper certification is obtained
- The certification covers all employers' assets

---

## Planning Considerations

### Understanding the Plan Structure

| Area | Questions to Address |
|------|---------------------|
| Plan Type | MEP, Association MEP, or PEP? |
| Governance | Who is the plan sponsor? Plan administrator? |
| Employers | How many participating employers? |
| PPP (if PEP) | Who is the PPP? Are they registered? |
| Service Providers | Who handles recordkeeping, custody, TPA functions? |
| Contributions | Are contribution formulas uniform or employer-specific? |
| Investments | Common investment menu or employer-specific? |

### Risk Assessment Considerations

| Risk Factor | Higher Risk Indicators |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Number of employers | Many employers with high turnover |
| Employer diversity | Varied industries, sizes, locations |
| Contribution complexity | Multiple formulas, employer-specific |
| Data integration | Multiple payroll systems, manual processes |
| PPP experience | New PPP, limited track record |
| Growth rate | Rapid addition of new employers |
| Employer withdrawals | High turnover of participating employers |

### Materiality Considerations

**Plan-Level Materiality:**
Calculate materiality based on total plan assets, not per employer.

**Employer-Level Considerations:**
- Consider if employer-level testing is appropriate
- Identify employers that are individually significant
- Consider disaggregated approach for certain procedures

### Planning Documentation

Document in your planning memo:
- [ ] Plan structure (MEP type or PEP)
- [ ] List of all participating employers
- [ ] Participant count by employer
- [ ] Contribution formulas by employer
- [ ] Investment structure
- [ ] PPP information (if PEP)
- [ ] Key service provider relationships

## Common Issues and Challenges

### Issue 1: Late Contributions by Individual Employers

**Challenge:** Different employers remit contributions at different times; some may be late.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Track contribution timing by employer
- Document late remittances by employer
- Consider if individual employer's late contributions are material to the plan
- Ensure proper disclosure in Schedule of Delinquent Contributions

**Resolution:**
- Report on Schedule of Delinquent Contributions
- Consider implications for prohibited transaction reporting
- Evaluate need for lost earnings correction

### Issue 2: Employer Withdrawal Mid-Year

**Challenge:** An employer withdraws from the MEP/PEP during the audit year.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Verify proper notice to participants
- Test asset distribution calculations
- Verify no assets were commingled after withdrawal
- Consider audit scope for withdrawn employer period

**Procedures:**
1. Obtain withdrawal documentation
2. Verify participant notifications
3. Test final account balance calculations
4. Trace asset distributions
5. Verify proper Form 5500 reporting

### Issue 3: Varied Contribution Formulas

**Challenge:** Each employer has different contribution formulas making testing complex.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Document each employer's formula
- Stratify sample by formula type
- Test calculations per applicable formula
- Consider automated testing vs. manual

**Approach:**
```
Employer A: 100% match on first 3% deferred
Employer B: 50% match on first 6% deferred
Employer C: 3% safe harbor non-elective

Testing must verify correct formula applied to correct employer's participants
```

### Issue 4: Allocation of Administrative Expenses

**Challenge:** How expenses are allocated among employers affects fairness.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Understand expense allocation methodology
- Evaluate reasonableness of allocation
- Test allocation calculations
- Consider prohibited transaction implications

**Common Allocation Methods:**
| Method | Description | Considerations |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Per capita | Equal per participant | Simple but may disadvantage small employers |
| Pro rata (assets) | Based on employer's % of assets | Benefits smaller employers |
| Per employer | Flat fee per employer | Disadvantages smaller employers |
| Usage-based | Based on transactions/services | Complex to administer |

### Issue 5: Compliance Testing Complexity

**Challenge:** Some tests are plan-wide, others are per-employer.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Understand which approach is used for each test
- Verify approach is consistent with plan document
- Test HCE/NHCE classification by employer
- Ensure failed tests are properly corrected

**Testing Matrix:**

| Test | Testing Level | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| ADP/ACP | Plan-wide OR per employer | Plan document determines |
| Coverage (410(b)) | Per employer | Required |
| Top-Heavy | Per employer | Required |
| 415 Limits | Per employer | Required |
| 401(a)(17) | Per employer | Required |

### Issue 6: Data Integration Issues

**Challenge:** Multiple employers use different payroll systems.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Understand data flow from each employer
- Identify reconciliation controls
- Test data accuracy across systems
- Consider increased substantive testing

**Procedures:**
1. Understand data feeds from each payroll system
2. Test reconciliation of contributions
3. Test accuracy of census data
4. Evaluate data integrity controls

### Issue 7: One Bad Apple Situations (MEPs)

**Challenge:** One employer's compliance failure could affect the entire plan.

**Audit Considerations:**
- Identify any compliance failures by employer
- Evaluate corrective action taken
- Consider impact on plan qualification
- Document in management letter

**PEP Advantage:**
For PEPs, the "one bad apple" rule does not apply. If an employer fails to correct:
- PPP can spin off that employer's assets
- Other employers are not affected
- Non-compliant employer bears consequences alone
