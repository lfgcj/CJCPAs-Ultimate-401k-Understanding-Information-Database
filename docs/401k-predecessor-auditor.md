## Common Issues and Red Flags

### Red Flags in Predecessor Communication

| Red Flag | Implication | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Client won't authorize communication | Potential integrity issue | Consider declining |
| Predecessor won't respond | May indicate problems | Document, proceed cautiously |
| Predecessor significantly limits response | May be hiding issues | Inquire further, consider implications |
| Disagreements cited | May recur | Understand details, assess |
| Fraud or illegal acts mentioned | Serious | Full investigation before accepting |
| Multiple auditor changes | Pattern of problems | Investigate reasons |
| Predecessor resigned | Rare, significant | Understand fully |

### Common Issues in 401(k) Plan Auditor Changes

| Issue | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-----------------|
| Late deferrals | Were there repeated late deposit findings? |
| Compliance failures | Were ADP/ACP tests failed repeatedly? |
| Documentation gaps | Were plan documents incomplete/missing? |
| Prohibited transactions | Were prohibited transactions identified? |
| Fee disputes | Were there disputes about audit fees? |
| Scope limitations | Were there issues obtaining information? |

### Client Explanations and Evaluation

| Client's Stated Reason | Evaluation Points |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Seeking competitive bids | Normal business practice |
| Not satisfied with service | Inquire about specific issues |
| Lower fees elsewhere | Consider if scope was adequate |
| Personality conflict | May mask other issues |
| Want fresh perspective | Reasonable, but verify |
| Predecessor retired/left | Verify independently |
| Consultant recommended change | Understand consultant's role |

---

## Report Considerations

### Impact on Audit Report

| Situation | Report Consideration |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Clean predecessor communication | No report modification needed |
| Prior year modified opinion | Evaluate if issue persists |
| Unable to verify opening balances | May need qualified opinion on Statement of Changes |
| Prior period adjustment discovered | Disclose in notes, consider opinion impact |
| Predecessor identified fraud | Consider current year implications |

### Comparative Financial Statement Considerations

| Prior Year Presentation | Current Year Action |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Prior year audited by predecessor | Include predecessor's report or reference in notes |
| Prior year audited with modifications | Disclose nature of modifications |
| Prior year not audited | Single-year presentation acceptable |
