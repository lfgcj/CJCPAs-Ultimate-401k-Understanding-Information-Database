## Participant Count Requirements

### Basic Threshold

A 401(k) plan requires an annual audit when it has **100 or more eligible participants** at the beginning of the plan year.

### Who Counts as a Participant

**Include:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Active with balance | Currently employed with account balance |
| Active without balance | Eligible, enrolled, but $0 balance |
| Eligible not enrolled | Met eligibility, declined to participate |
| Terminated with balance | Former employees owed benefits |
| Retired with balance | Retirees with remaining account balance |
| Deceased with benefits owed | Accounts pending distribution to beneficiaries |
| Participants on leave | Those on leave of absence |

**Exclude:**

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Terminated with $0 | No longer owed benefits |
| Ineligible employees | Haven't met eligibility requirements |
| Beneficiaries | Count participant, not multiple beneficiaries |
| Former participants paid out | Received full distribution |

### Counting Date

- Count is as of **first day of plan year**
- For calendar year: January 1
- For fiscal year: First day of fiscal year
- Count determines entire year's requirement

### Voluntary Audit Exception

Even if under 100 participants, plan may voluntarily:
- Have audit performed
- Attach to Form 5500
- File as large plan

## 80-120 Participant Rule Details

### Purpose

The 80-120 rule provides administrative relief for plans near the 100-participant threshold, preventing audit status from fluctuating year to year.

### How It Works

#### Scenario 1: Small Plan Growing

```
Prior Year: 95 participants (small plan, no audit)
Current Year: 110 participants

110 is between 100 and 120
Prior year filed as small plan
May continue filing as small plan

Current Year: 125 participants
Now exceeds 120
Must file as large plan with audit
```

#### Scenario 2: Large Plan Shrinking

```
Prior Year: 105 participants (large plan, audit required)
Current Year: 95 participants

95 is between 80 and 100
Prior year filed as large plan
May continue filing as large plan

Current Year: 78 participants
Now below 80
May file as small plan without audit
```

### Decision Matrix

| Prior Year Status | Current Count | Required Action |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Small (<100) | Under 100 | Small plan |
| Small (<100) | 100-120 | May remain small |
| Small (<100) | Over 120 | Large plan (audit) |
| Large (100+) | Under 80 | May become small |
| Large (100+) | 80-120 | May remain large |
| Large (100+) | Over 100 | Large plan (audit) |

### First Year Plans

New plans:
- Count at beginning of plan year
- Usually 0 or few participants at start
- No audit typically required first year
- Monitor growth carefully

### Documentation

Maintain records showing:
- Beginning of year participant count
- Methodology for counting
- Categories included/excluded
