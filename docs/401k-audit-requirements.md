## Do I Need a 401(k) Audit This Year?

This is one of the most common questions plan sponsors ask. The answer depends on your participant count and filing history. Here's how to figure it out quickly.

### The Simple Answer

**If your plan has 100 or more participants with account balances at the beginning of the plan year, you generally need an audit.** But there's a transition rule (the "80-120 rule") that provides some flexibility.

### Important: 2023 Participant Count Changes

**Effective for plan years beginning January 1, 2023**, the DOL changed how participants are counted:

| Before 2023 | After 2023 |
|-------------|------------|
| Count all **eligible** participants | Count only participants **with account balances** |
| Included employees who declined to participate | Only includes those with actual money in the plan |

This change reduced audit requirements for approximately 20,000 small business plans.

### Where to Find Your Participant Count

Look at **Line 6 on your prior year Form 5500**. This shows the number of participants with account balances at the beginning of the plan year. For a calendar year plan, this is January 1st.

### First Plan Year Rules - CRITICAL DISTINCTION

**First-year plans are NOT automatically exempt.** The rules depend on plan year length:

| Plan Year Length | Participant Count Timing | Result if 100+ Participants |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| More than 7 months | Count at **END** of plan year | Audit **REQUIRED** this year |
| 7 months or less | Count at **END** of plan year | Audit can be **DEFERRED** to Year 2 |

**Why count at year-end for new plans?** A brand new plan has zero participants at the beginning—there are no accounts yet. So for the first plan year only, the count is based on participants with account balances at the **end** of the plan year.

### The 7-Month Short Plan Year Deferral (29 CFR 2520.104-50)

If your plan's first year is **7 months or less**, you may **defer** (not waive) the audit:

- **Deferral means**: The audit is postponed to the following year, not eliminated
- **Combined audit**: The second year's audit will cover BOTH plan years
- **Example**: Plan effective October 1, 2024 (calendar year-end). The 3-month short year audit can be deferred and combined with the 2025 audit
- **Still required**: If 100+ participants with balances at year-end, you still need an audit—just combined with the next year

**Important**: This is a DEFERRAL, not an exemption. The plan will still be audited.

### Quick Scenarios Table

| Scenario | Prior Year Filing | Participants (with balances) | Audit Required? |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Growing plan | Small plan | 100-120 at BOY | **NO** - Can stay small |
| Growing plan | Small plan | 121+ at BOY | **YES** - Must file large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | 100-120 at BOY | **YES** - Must stay large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | 80-99 at BOY | **YES** - Must stay large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | <80 at BOY | **NO** - Can file small |
| Stable small | Small plan | <100 at BOY | **NO** - Stay small |
| Stable large | Large plan | 100+ at BOY | **YES** - Stay large |
| New plan (>7 mo) | N/A | <100 at EOY | **NO** - File as small |
| New plan (>7 mo) | N/A | 100+ at EOY | **YES** - Audit required |
| New plan (≤7 mo) | N/A | <100 at EOY | **NO** - File as small |
| New plan (≤7 mo) | N/A | 100+ at EOY | **DEFERRED** - Combined with Year 2 audit |

*BOY = Beginning of Year; EOY = End of Year*

### Quick Reference Rules

1. **121+ participants with balances = Always need an audit** (no exceptions)
2. **Under 80 participants with balances = Never need an audit** (unless prior year was large)
3. **80-120 participants = Depends on prior year filing status** (80-120 rule)
4. **First year of plan = Based on YEAR-END count** (not exempt—count at year-end, not beginning)
5. **Short plan year (≤7 months) = Can DEFER audit** (not exempt—combined audit covers 2 years)
6. **"Once large, stay large"** until you drop below 80 participants
7. **Since 2023: Count only participants with account balances** (not all eligible employees)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "We only count eligible employees" | **OUTDATED** - Since 2023, count only participants **with account balances** |
| "We're at 115, we were 98 last year, no audit needed" | Correct! The 80-120 rule protects you |
| "We dropped to 85 from 130, we're under 100!" | Wrong - you need 79 or fewer to drop out of audit |
| "Our new plan started July 1 with 200 employees, no audit" | **WRONG** - Count at year-end. If 100+ have balances at 12/31, audit is required (plan year >7 months, no deferral) |
| "Our plan started Oct 1, 150 employees, first year exempt" | **WRONG** - Can DEFER to Year 2, but audit still required (covers both years) |
| "First-year plans are exempt from audits" | **WRONG** - First-year plans use year-end count; audit required if 100+ |

### Still Unsure?

When in doubt:
1. Pull your prior year Form 5500
2. Look at Line 5 (small plan checkbox) or Line 6 (participant count with balances)
3. Count your current participants **with account balances** as of 1/1
4. For first-year plans, count participants with balances at **year-end**
5. Follow the decision tree above

## Participant Count Requirements

### Basic Threshold

A 401(k) plan requires an annual audit when it has **100 or more participants with account balances** at the beginning of the plan year.

### 2023 Regulatory Change - IMPORTANT

**Effective for plan years beginning January 1, 2023**, the DOL changed the participant counting methodology under 29 CFR 2520.103-1:

| Rule | Before 2023 | After 2023 |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Who to count | All **eligible** participants | Only participants **with account balances** |
| Zero-balance accounts | Counted | Not counted |
| Eligible but not enrolled | Counted | Not counted |
| Impact | Higher participant counts | Lower participant counts |

This change was made in anticipation of long-term part-time (LTPT) employee requirements under SECURE 2.0, which will make more employees eligible but may not result in contributions.

### Who Counts as a Participant (Post-2023)

**Include (Participants WITH Account Balances):**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Active with balance | Currently employed with account balance > $0 |
| Terminated with balance | Former employees with remaining account balance |
| Retired with balance | Retirees with remaining account balance |
| Deceased with benefits owed | Accounts pending distribution to beneficiaries |
| Participants on leave with balance | Those on leave with account balance > $0 |

**Exclude:**

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Active without balance | No account balance to count (new 2023 rule) |
| Eligible not enrolled | No account balance (new 2023 rule) |
| Terminated with $0 | No account balance |
| Ineligible employees | Haven't met eligibility requirements |
| Beneficiaries | Count participant, not multiple beneficiaries |
| Former participants paid out | Received full distribution, $0 balance |

### Counting Date

**For Existing Plans:**
- Count is as of **first day of plan year**
- For calendar year: January 1
- For fiscal year: First day of fiscal year
- Count determines entire year's requirement

**For First Plan Year:**
- Count is as of **last day of the plan year** (since no participants have balances at the beginning of a new plan)
- See [First Plan Year Rules](#first-plan-year-rules---critical-distinction) for details

### Voluntary Audit Exception

Even if under 100 participants, plan may voluntarily:
- Have audit performed
- Attach to Form 5500
- File as large plan

---

## 80-120 Participant Rule Details

### Purpose

The 80-120 rule provides administrative relief for plans near the 100-participant threshold, preventing audit status from fluctuating year to year.

### How It Works

#### Scenario 1: Small Plan Growing

```
Prior Year: 95 participants (small plan, no audit)
Current Year: 110 participants

110 is between 100 and 120
Prior year filed as small plan
May continue filing as small plan

Current Year: 125 participants
Now exceeds 120
Must file as large plan with audit
```

#### Scenario 2: Large Plan Shrinking

```
Prior Year: 105 participants (large plan, audit required)
Current Year: 95 participants

95 is between 80 and 100
Prior year filed as large plan
May continue filing as large plan

Current Year: 78 participants
Now below 80
May file as small plan without audit
```

### Decision Matrix

| Prior Year Status | Current Count | Required Action |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Small (<100) | Under 100 | Small plan |
| Small (<100) | 100-120 | May remain small |
| Small (<100) | Over 120 | Large plan (audit) |
| Large (100+) | Under 80 | May become small |
| Large (100+) | 80-120 | May remain large |
| Large (100+) | Over 100 | Large plan (audit) |

### First Year Plans

**First-year plans follow DIFFERENT rules than existing plans:**

| Rule | Existing Plans | First-Year Plans |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Count timing | Beginning of year | **End of year** |
| Why | Prior year baseline exists | No participants at beginning of new plan |
| Audit trigger | 100+ at BOY | 100+ at EOY |

**Short Plan Year Deferral (29 CFR 2520.104-50):**
- If the first plan year is **7 months or less**, the audit can be **deferred** to Year 2
- The Year 2 audit will cover **both** plan years
- This is a deferral, NOT an exemption—audit is still required

**Examples:**

| Effective Date | Plan Year End | Plan Year Length | 100+ at EOY? | Result |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| January 1, 2025 | December 31, 2025 | 12 months | Yes | Audit required for 2025 |
| January 1, 2025 | December 31, 2025 | 12 months | No | No audit required |
| July 1, 2025 | December 31, 2025 | 6 months | Yes | Can defer audit to 2026 (covers both years) |
| July 1, 2025 | December 31, 2025 | 6 months | No | No audit required |
| September 1, 2025 | December 31, 2025 | 4 months | Yes | Can defer audit to 2026 (covers both years) |
