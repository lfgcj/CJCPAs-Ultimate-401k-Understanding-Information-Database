## Part 1: Standard Required Disclosures

### Note 1: Description of Plan

#### General Plan Description

The [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan") is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible employees of [COMPANY NAME] (the "Company" or "Plan Sponsor") who have attained age [21] and completed [1 year/1,000 hours] of service. The Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Participants should refer to the Plan document and Summary Plan Description for a more complete description of the Plan's provisions.

#### Contributions

**Employee Contributions**

Participants may elect to defer up to [XX]% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") limitations. For the plan year ended [DATE], the maximum elective deferral was $[23,500] ($[31,000] for participants age 50 and older). Participants may also elect to make Roth (after-tax) contributions subject to the same limitations.

**Employer Matching Contributions**

*Alternative - Safe Harbor Non-Elective:*
The Plan is designed as a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. The Company provides a Safe Harbor non-elective contribution equal to 3% of eligible compensation to all eligible participants regardless of whether they make elective deferrals.

**Employer Profit Sharing Contributions**

**Rollover Contributions**

The Plan accepts rollover contributions from other qualified plans, 403(b) plans, governmental 457(b) plans, and Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs").

#### Participant Accounts

Each participant's account is credited with the participant's elective deferrals, employer contributions, Plan earnings, and is charged with an allocation of administrative expenses. Allocations are based on participant account balances or eligible compensation, as defined in the Plan document. The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided from the participant's vested account balance.

#### Vesting

**Employee Contributions**
Participants are immediately vested in their elective deferrals and rollover contributions, plus actual earnings thereon.

**Employer Contributions**

*Graded Vesting Schedule:*
Employer matching and profit sharing contributions vest according to the following schedule:

| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 1 year | 0% |
| 1 year | 20% |
| 2 years | 40% |
| 3 years | 60% |

#### Forfeitures

Forfeited non-vested accounts are used to [reduce future employer contributions / pay Plan administrative expenses / allocate to remaining participants]. At [YEAR END DATE], forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $[AMOUNT]. During the plan year ended [DATE], forfeitures of $[AMOUNT] were used to [reduce employer contributions / pay administrative expenses].

#### Payment of Benefits

Upon termination of employment, death, disability, or attainment of age 59½, participants may elect to receive their vested account balance in a lump sum payment, installment payments, or as a direct rollover to another qualified plan or IRA. Hardship withdrawals and in-service withdrawals at age 59½ are also permitted as described in the Plan document.

#### Participant Loans

The Plan permits participants to borrow from their account balances up to the lesser of $50,000 (reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance during the preceding 12 months) or 50% of the participant's vested account balance. Loans bear interest at [prime rate plus 1%] and must be repaid within [5] years, or up to [15/20/25] years for the purchase of a primary residence. Principal and interest are repaid through payroll deductions.

*Alternative - No Loans:*
The Plan does not permit participant loans.

Certain administrative expenses of maintaining the Plan are paid by the Plan, while other expenses are paid by the Company. Expenses paid by the Plan are allocated to participant accounts [pro rata based on account balances / per capita / as specifically incurred].

---

### Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

#### Basis of Accounting

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

#### Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of additions and deductions during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

#### Investment Valuation and Income Recognition

Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. See Note [X] for discussion of fair value measurements.

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation (depreciation) includes the Plan's gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held during the year.

#### Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts

The Plan holds investments in [stable value fund / guaranteed investment contracts] that are fully benefit-responsive. These investments are reported at fair value in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits with an adjustment to contract value in a separate line item. Contract value represents contributions plus accumulated interest. Participants may ordinarily direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value. See Note [X] for additional information.

*Alternative - If no stable value:*
The Plan does not hold any investments in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts.

#### Notes Receivable from Participants

Notes receivable from participants represent participant loans that are recorded at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Delinquent loans are reclassified as distributions based on the terms of the Plan document. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of [DATE]. If a participant ceases to make loan repayments and the Plan administrator deems the participant loan to be a distribution, the participant loan balance is reduced and a benefit payment is recorded.

#### Payment of Benefits

Benefits are recorded when paid.

#### Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

*Include if applicable:*
In [MONTH YEAR], the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") [NUMBER], [TITLE]. [Describe the standard and its impact on the Plan's financial statements, or state that it is not expected to have a material impact.]

---

### Note 3: Tax Status

The Plan obtained its latest determination letter on [DATE], in which the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") stated that the Plan, as then designed, was in compliance with applicable requirements of the IRC. The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter; however, the Plan administrator and the Plan's tax counsel believe that the Plan is currently designed and being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the IRC and, therefore, believe that the Plan is qualified and the related trust is tax-exempt.

GAAP requires Plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the Plan and recognize a tax liability if the Plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. The Plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the Plan, and has concluded that as of [DATE], there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or disclosure in the financial statements.

The Plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress.

---

### Note 4: Fair Value Measurements

FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, *Fair Value Measurement*, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows:

**Level 1** - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access.

**Level 2** - Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
- Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets
- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
- Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means

**Level 3** - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The asset's or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value:

**Mutual Funds**: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value ("NAV") and to transact at that price. Mutual funds held by the Plan are actively traded and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Common/Collective Trust Funds**: Valued at the NAV of units held by the Plan at year-end as provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

**Employer Securities**: Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. These securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

*Alternative for privately held employer securities:*
**Employer Securities**: The Plan holds stock of [COMPANY NAME], a privately held company. These securities are valued based on an independent appraisal performed annually as of [DATE]. The valuation methodology considers factors such as earnings, book value, and market comparables. These securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts**: Investments in self-directed brokerage accounts consist primarily of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and money market funds. These investments are valued at quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

#### Fair Value Hierarchy Table

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of [DATE]:

| | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |
|---|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Mutual funds: | | | | |
| Equity funds | $X | $— | $— | $X |
| Fixed income funds | X | — | — | X |
| Money market funds | X | — | — | X |
| Employer securities | X | — | — | X |
| **Total assets in fair value hierarchy** | **$X** | **$—** | **$—** | **$X** |
| Investments measured at NAV* | | | | X |
| **Total investments at fair value** | | | | **$X** |

*Investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

#### Investments Measured Using Net Asset Value Per Share

The following table summarizes investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share practical expedient as of [DATE]:

| Investment | Fair Value | Unfunded Commitments | Redemption Frequency | Redemption Notice Period |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Common/collective trust - stable value | $X | N/A | Daily | None |
| Common/collective trust - equity index | X | N/A | Daily | None |
| Common/collective trust - target date | X | N/A | Daily | None |
| **Total** | **$X** | | | |

### Note 5: Party-in-Interest / Related Party Transactions

Certain Plan investments are managed by [TRUSTEE/RECORDKEEPER NAME], which is the trustee and recordkeeper of the Plan. These transactions qualify as party-in-interest transactions; however, they are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules under ERISA.

The Plan holds [NUMBER] shares of common stock of [COMPANY NAME], the Plan Sponsor, valued at $[AMOUNT] at [DATE]. Purchases, sales, and dividends related to employer securities qualify as party-in-interest transactions but are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules.

Loans to participants are also party-in-interest transactions but are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules.

At [DATE], the Plan held $[AMOUNT] in notes receivable from participants, which bear interest at rates ranging from [X]% to [Y]%.

Certain administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company on behalf of the Plan. Such amounts are excluded from these financial statements.

---

### Note 6: Plan Termination

Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the right under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA. In the event of Plan termination, participants will become 100% vested in their accounts.

---

### Note 7: Risks and Uncertainties

The Plan provides for various investment options in mutual funds, common/collective trust funds, and employer securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect the amounts reported in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits.

*Additional disclosure for employer securities:*
Plan assets include [COMPANY NAME] common stock, representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets at [DATE]. A significant decline in the market value of [COMPANY NAME] common stock would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.

*Additional disclosure for concentrated investments:*
Plan assets include investments in [FUND NAME], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets at [DATE]. A significant decline in the market value of this investment would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.

---

## Part 2: Investment Disclosures

### Note: Investments

The following presents investments that represent 5% or more of the Plan's net assets at [DATE]:

| Investment | Fair Value |
|------------|-----------|
| [FUND NAME 1] | $X |
| [FUND NAME 2] | X |
| [FUND NAME 3] | X |
| Employer common stock | X |

During the plan year ended [DATE], the Plan's investments (including gains and losses on investments bought and sold, as well as held during the year) appreciated (depreciated) in fair value as follows:

| Investment Type | Net Appreciation (Depreciation) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Mutual funds | $X |
| Common/collective trust funds | X |
| Employer securities | X |
| **Total** | **$X** |

---

### Note: Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts (Stable Value)

The Plan holds a fully benefit-responsive investment contract with [INSURANCE COMPANY/STABLE VALUE FUND NAME]. This investment is presented at fair value in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits with an adjustment to contract value in a separate line item.

As described in ASC 962, *Plan Accounting – Defined Contribution Pension Plans*, investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value. However, contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit-responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the Plan.

The stable value fund invests primarily in investment contracts issued by insurance companies and other financial institutions, fixed income securities, and money market funds. Participants may ordinarily direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value.

As of [DATE], the fair value and contract value of the fully benefit-responsive investment contracts were as follows:

| | [CURRENT YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|---|---------------|--------------|
| Fair value | $X | $X |
| Adjustment from fair value to contract value | X | X |
| **Contract value** | **$X** | **$X** |

The average yield and crediting interest rate for the stable value fund were as follows:

| | [CURRENT YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|---|---------------|--------------|
| Average yield | X.XX% | X.XX% |
| Crediting interest rate | X.XX% | X.XX% |

The crediting interest rate is based on an agreed-upon formula with the issuer, but may not be less than zero. Such rate is reviewed on a quarterly basis for resetting.

Certain events limit the ability of the Plan to transact at contract value with the contract issuers. Such events include:
- Amendments to the Plan document
- Complete or partial Plan termination or merger with another plan
- Employer bankruptcy or reorganization
- Changes to competing investment options
- Failure to qualify under Section 401(a) of the IRC

The Plan administrator does not believe that any events that would limit the Plan's ability to transact at contract value with participants are probable of occurring.

---

### Note: Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts

The Plan offers participants the option to invest a portion of their account balance in a self-directed brokerage account ("SDBA") through [BROKERAGE PROVIDER]. Participants may invest in a wide range of investments including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, individual stocks, and bonds, subject to certain restrictions as outlined in the Plan document.

As of [DATE], the SDBA held investments with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets. The investments held in the SDBA are participant-directed, and the Plan has no fiduciary responsibility for the selection of investments within the SDBA.

---

### Note: Employer Securities

The Plan allows participants to invest in common stock of [COMPANY NAME], the Plan Sponsor. Employer securities are participant-directed and subject to the diversification requirements under ERISA Section 204(j).

As of [DATE], the Plan held [NUMBER] shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets.

Dividends on employer securities are [reinvested in additional shares of company stock / paid in cash to participants / allocated based on participant elections].

---

### Note: Alternative Investments

*For plans with hedge funds, private equity, real estate, etc.:*

The Plan holds investments in alternative investment funds as part of a diversified investment strategy. These investments may include:

| Investment | Fair Value | Strategy |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| [FUND NAME] | $X | [Private equity / Hedge fund / Real estate] |

Due to the nature of these investments, values may be estimated using the most recent available information, which may differ from values that would be determined if a ready market existed. The Plan's ability to redeem these investments may be subject to lock-up periods and other restrictions as described in the fund offering documents.
