## Part 1: Standard Required Disclosures

### Note 1: Description of Plan

#### General Plan Description

The [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan") is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible employees of [COMPANY NAME] (the "Company" or "Plan Sponsor") who have attained age [21] and completed [1 year/1,000 hours] of service. The Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Participants should refer to the Plan document and Summary Plan Description for a more complete description of the Plan's provisions.

#### Contributions

**Employee Contributions**

Participants may elect to defer up to [XX]% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") limitations. For the plan year ended [DATE], the maximum elective deferral was $[23,500] ($[31,000] for participants age 50 and older). Participants may also elect to make Roth (after-tax) contributions subject to the same limitations.

**Employer Matching Contributions**

The Company provides a matching contribution equal to [100]% of the first [3]% of compensation deferred, plus [50]% of the next [2]% of compensation deferred, for a maximum match of [4]% of eligible compensation.

*Alternative - Safe Harbor Match:*
The Plan is designed as a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. The Company provides a Safe Harbor matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 3% of compensation deferred, plus 50% of the next 2% of compensation deferred, for a maximum match of 4% of eligible compensation.

*Alternative - Safe Harbor Non-Elective:*
The Plan is designed as a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. The Company provides a Safe Harbor non-elective contribution equal to 3% of eligible compensation to all eligible participants regardless of whether they make elective deferrals.

**Employer Profit Sharing Contributions**

The Company may make discretionary profit sharing contributions as determined annually by the Board of Directors. For the plan year ended [DATE], the Company contributed $[AMOUNT] in profit sharing contributions.

*Alternative - No Profit Sharing:*
The Plan does not provide for employer profit sharing contributions.

**Rollover Contributions**

The Plan accepts rollover contributions from other qualified plans, 403(b) plans, governmental 457(b) plans, and Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs").

#### Participant Accounts

Each participant's account is credited with the participant's elective deferrals, employer contributions, Plan earnings, and is charged with an allocation of administrative expenses. Allocations are based on participant account balances or eligible compensation, as defined in the Plan document. The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided from the participant's vested account balance.

#### Vesting

**Employee Contributions**
Participants are immediately vested in their elective deferrals and rollover contributions, plus actual earnings thereon.

**Employer Contributions**

*Graded Vesting Schedule:*
Employer matching and profit sharing contributions vest according to the following schedule:

| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 1 year | 0% |
| 1 year | 20% |
| 2 years | 40% |
| 3 years | 60% |
| 4 years | 80% |
| 5 years | 100% |

*Cliff Vesting Schedule:*
Employer matching and profit sharing contributions vest 100% after [3] years of service.

*Immediate Vesting:*
Participants are immediately vested in all employer contributions.

*Safe Harbor Vesting:*
Participants are immediately vested in all Safe Harbor contributions. Non-Safe Harbor employer contributions vest according to [the schedule described above].

#### Forfeitures

Forfeited non-vested accounts are used to [reduce future employer contributions / pay Plan administrative expenses / allocate to remaining participants]. At [YEAR END DATE], forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $[AMOUNT]. During the plan year ended [DATE], forfeitures of $[AMOUNT] were used to [reduce employer contributions / pay administrative expenses].

#### Payment of Benefits

Upon termination of employment, death, disability, or attainment of age 59½, participants may elect to receive their vested account balance in a lump sum payment, installment payments, or as a direct rollover to another qualified plan or IRA. Hardship withdrawals and in-service withdrawals at age 59½ are also permitted as described in the Plan document.

#### Participant Loans

The Plan permits participants to borrow from their account balances up to the lesser of $50,000 (reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance during the preceding 12 months) or 50% of the participant's vested account balance. Loans bear interest at [prime rate plus 1%] and must be repaid within [5] years, or up to [15/20/25] years for the purchase of a primary residence. Principal and interest are repaid through payroll deductions.

*Alternative - No Loans:*
The Plan does not permit participant loans.

#### Administrative Expenses

Certain administrative expenses of maintaining the Plan are paid by the Plan, while other expenses are paid by the Company. Expenses paid by the Plan are allocated to participant accounts [pro rata based on account balances / per capita / as specifically incurred].

---

### Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

#### Basis of Accounting

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

#### Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of additions and deductions during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

#### Investment Valuation and Income Recognition

Investments are reported at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. See Note [X] for discussion of fair value measurements.

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation (depreciation) includes the Plan's gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held during the year.

#### Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts

The Plan holds investments in [stable value fund / guaranteed investment contracts] that are fully benefit-responsive. These investments are reported at fair value in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits with an adjustment to contract value in a separate line item. Contract value represents contributions plus accumulated interest. Participants may ordinarily direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value. See Note [X] for additional information.

*Alternative - If no stable value:*
The Plan does not hold any investments in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts.

#### Notes Receivable from Participants

Notes receivable from participants represent participant loans that are recorded at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Delinquent loans are reclassified as distributions based on the terms of the Plan document. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of [DATE]. If a participant ceases to make loan repayments and the Plan administrator deems the participant loan to be a distribution, the participant loan balance is reduced and a benefit payment is recorded.

#### Payment of Benefits

Benefits are recorded when paid.

#### Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

*Include if applicable:*
In [MONTH YEAR], the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") [NUMBER], [TITLE]. [Describe the standard and its impact on the Plan's financial statements, or state that it is not expected to have a material impact.]

---

### Note 3: Tax Status

The Plan obtained its latest determination letter on [DATE], in which the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") stated that the Plan, as then designed, was in compliance with applicable requirements of the IRC. The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter; however, the Plan administrator and the Plan's tax counsel believe that the Plan is currently designed and being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the IRC and, therefore, believe that the Plan is qualified and the related trust is tax-exempt.

GAAP requires Plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the Plan and recognize a tax liability if the Plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. The Plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the Plan, and has concluded that as of [DATE], there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or disclosure in the financial statements.

The Plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress.

---

### Note 4: Fair Value Measurements

FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, *Fair Value Measurement*, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows:

**Level 1** - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access.

**Level 2** - Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
- Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets
- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
- Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means

**Level 3** - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The asset's or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value:

**Mutual Funds**: Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value ("NAV") and to transact at that price. Mutual funds held by the Plan are actively traded and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Common/Collective Trust Funds**: Valued at the NAV of units held by the Plan at year-end as provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

**Employer Securities**: Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. These securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

*Alternative for privately held employer securities:*
**Employer Securities**: The Plan holds stock of [COMPANY NAME], a privately held company. These securities are valued based on an independent appraisal performed annually as of [DATE]. The valuation methodology considers factors such as earnings, book value, and market comparables. These securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts**: Investments in self-directed brokerage accounts consist primarily of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and money market funds. These investments are valued at quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

#### Fair Value Hierarchy Table

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of [DATE]:

| | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |
|---|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Mutual funds: | | | | |
| Equity funds | $X | $— | $— | $X |
| Fixed income funds | X | — | — | X |
| Money market funds | X | — | — | X |
| Employer securities | X | — | — | X |
| **Total assets in fair value hierarchy** | **$X** | **$—** | **$—** | **$X** |
| Investments measured at NAV* | | | | X |
| **Total investments at fair value** | | | | **$X** |

*Investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

#### Investments Measured Using Net Asset Value Per Share

The following table summarizes investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share practical expedient as of [DATE]:

| Investment | Fair Value | Unfunded Commitments | Redemption Frequency | Redemption Notice Period |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Common/collective trust - stable value | $X | N/A | Daily | None |
| Common/collective trust - equity index | X | N/A | Daily | None |
| Common/collective trust - target date | X | N/A | Daily | None |
| **Total** | **$X** | | | |

### Note 5: Party-in-Interest / Related Party Transactions

Certain Plan investments are managed by [TRUSTEE/RECORDKEEPER NAME], which is the trustee and recordkeeper of the Plan. These transactions qualify as party-in-interest transactions; however, they are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules under ERISA.

The Plan holds [NUMBER] shares of common stock of [COMPANY NAME], the Plan Sponsor, valued at $[AMOUNT] at [DATE]. Purchases, sales, and dividends related to employer securities qualify as party-in-interest transactions but are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules.

Loans to participants are also party-in-interest transactions but are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules.

At [DATE], the Plan held $[AMOUNT] in notes receivable from participants, which bear interest at rates ranging from [X]% to [Y]%.

Certain administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company on behalf of the Plan. Such amounts are excluded from these financial statements.

---

### Note 6: Plan Termination

Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the right under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA. In the event of Plan termination, participants will become 100% vested in their accounts.

---

### Note 7: Risks and Uncertainties

The Plan provides for various investment options in mutual funds, common/collective trust funds, and employer securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect the amounts reported in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits.

*Additional disclosure for employer securities:*
Plan assets include [COMPANY NAME] common stock, representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets at [DATE]. A significant decline in the market value of [COMPANY NAME] common stock would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.

*Additional disclosure for concentrated investments:*
Plan assets include investments in [FUND NAME], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets at [DATE]. A significant decline in the market value of this investment would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.

---

## Part 2: Investment Disclosures

### Note: Investments

The following presents investments that represent 5% or more of the Plan's net assets at [DATE]:

| Investment | Fair Value |
|------------|-----------|
| [FUND NAME 1] | $X |
| [FUND NAME 2] | X |
| [FUND NAME 3] | X |
| Employer common stock | X |

During the plan year ended [DATE], the Plan's investments (including gains and losses on investments bought and sold, as well as held during the year) appreciated (depreciated) in fair value as follows:

| Investment Type | Net Appreciation (Depreciation) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Mutual funds | $X |
| Common/collective trust funds | X |
| Employer securities | X |
| **Total** | **$X** |

---

### Note: Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts (Stable Value)

The Plan holds a fully benefit-responsive investment contract with [INSURANCE COMPANY/STABLE VALUE FUND NAME]. This investment is presented at fair value in the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits with an adjustment to contract value in a separate line item.

As described in ASC 962, *Plan Accounting – Defined Contribution Pension Plans*, investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value. However, contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit-responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the Plan.

The stable value fund invests primarily in investment contracts issued by insurance companies and other financial institutions, fixed income securities, and money market funds. Participants may ordinarily direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value.

As of [DATE], the fair value and contract value of the fully benefit-responsive investment contracts were as follows:

| | [CURRENT YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|---|---------------|--------------|
| Fair value | $X | $X |
| Adjustment from fair value to contract value | X | X |
| **Contract value** | **$X** | **$X** |

The average yield and crediting interest rate for the stable value fund were as follows:

| | [CURRENT YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|---|---------------|--------------|
| Average yield | X.XX% | X.XX% |
| Crediting interest rate | X.XX% | X.XX% |

The crediting interest rate is based on an agreed-upon formula with the issuer, but may not be less than zero. Such rate is reviewed on a quarterly basis for resetting.

Certain events limit the ability of the Plan to transact at contract value with the contract issuers. Such events include:
- Amendments to the Plan document
- Complete or partial Plan termination or merger with another plan
- Employer bankruptcy or reorganization
- Changes to competing investment options
- Failure to qualify under Section 401(a) of the IRC

The Plan administrator does not believe that any events that would limit the Plan's ability to transact at contract value with participants are probable of occurring.

---

### Note: Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts

The Plan offers participants the option to invest a portion of their account balance in a self-directed brokerage account ("SDBA") through [BROKERAGE PROVIDER]. Participants may invest in a wide range of investments including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, individual stocks, and bonds, subject to certain restrictions as outlined in the Plan document.

As of [DATE], the SDBA held investments with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets. The investments held in the SDBA are participant-directed, and the Plan has no fiduciary responsibility for the selection of investments within the SDBA.

---

### Note: Employer Securities

The Plan allows participants to invest in common stock of [COMPANY NAME], the Plan Sponsor. Employer securities are participant-directed and subject to the diversification requirements under ERISA Section 204(j).

As of [DATE], the Plan held [NUMBER] shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets.

Dividends on employer securities are [reinvested in additional shares of company stock / paid in cash to participants / allocated based on participant elections].

---

### Note: Alternative Investments

*For plans with hedge funds, private equity, real estate, etc.:*

The Plan holds investments in alternative investment funds as part of a diversified investment strategy. These investments may include:

| Investment | Fair Value | Strategy |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| [FUND NAME] | $X | [Private equity / Hedge fund / Real estate] |

Due to the nature of these investments, values may be estimated using the most recent available information, which may differ from values that would be determined if a ready market existed. The Plan's ability to redeem these investments may be subject to lock-up periods and other restrictions as described in the fund offering documents.

---

### Note: Cryptocurrency / Digital Asset Investments

*For plans offering cryptocurrency or digital asset investment options:*

The Plan offers participants the option to invest in cryptocurrency/digital assets through [PROVIDER NAME / SELF-DIRECTED BROKERAGE WINDOW]. As of [DATE], the Plan held digital assets with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing approximately [X]% of total Plan assets.

**Valuation**

Digital assets are valued at fair value based on quoted prices on active cryptocurrency exchanges as of [TIME, e.g., 4:00 PM ET] on the last business day of the plan year. The Plan uses [EXCHANGE NAME / PRICING SERVICE] as its primary pricing source. Digital assets are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy when quoted prices in active markets are available, or Level 2 when pricing is derived from observable inputs from multiple exchanges.

**Digital Asset Holdings**

| Asset | Units Held | Fair Value |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | X.XXXX | $X |
| Ethereum (ETH) | X.XXXX | $X |
| [Other] | X.XXXX | $X |
| **Total Digital Assets** | | **$X** |

**Risks and Uncertainties**

Investments in digital assets are subject to significant risks including:
- **Price Volatility**: Cryptocurrency prices may fluctuate significantly in short periods
- **Regulatory Risk**: The regulatory environment for digital assets continues to evolve
- **Cybersecurity Risk**: Digital assets may be subject to theft through hacking or other cyber attacks
- **Liquidity Risk**: Certain digital assets may have limited liquidity
- **Technology Risk**: Blockchain technology and digital asset protocols may contain undiscovered flaws
- **Custody Risk**: Digital assets are held by [CUSTODIAN NAME] in [hot/cold] storage wallets

The Plan limits participant investment in digital assets to [X]% of account balance as a risk mitigation measure. Participants are provided with specific risk disclosures prior to investing in digital assets.

**DOL Guidance**

On March 10, 2022, the Department of Labor issued Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01, expressing significant concerns about the prudence of exposing 401(k) plan participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies. The Plan's fiduciaries have evaluated these concerns and [describe fiduciary analysis and rationale for offering digital assets].

*Alternative - Cryptocurrency through SDBA only:*

The Plan does not offer cryptocurrency as a designated investment option. However, participants may invest in cryptocurrency or digital assets through the Plan's self-directed brokerage account window. As of [DATE], participants held approximately $[AMOUNT] in digital assets through self-directed brokerage accounts. The Plan has no fiduciary responsibility for participant investment selections within the self-directed brokerage window.

*Alternative - No cryptocurrency exposure:*

The Plan does not permit investment in cryptocurrency or digital assets, either as a designated investment option or through the self-directed brokerage account window.

---

### Note: Master Trust Participation

The Plan participates in the [MASTER TRUST NAME] Master Trust (the "Master Trust"), which was established for the investment of assets of the Plan and [OTHER PARTICIPATING PLAN NAMES]. Each participating plan has an undivided interest in the Master Trust. The assets of the Master Trust are held by [TRUSTEE NAME].

At [DATE], the Plan's interest in the Master Trust was approximately [X]% based on the Plan's proportionate share of net assets. Investment income and administrative expenses are allocated to individual plans based upon average monthly balances invested by each plan.

The following presents the Plan's interest in the Master Trust at [DATE]:

| | Plan's Share | Total Master Trust |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| Investments at fair value | $X | $X |
| Adjustment to contract value | X | X |
| **Net assets** | **$X** | **$X** |

| | Plan's Share | Total Master Trust |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| Net investment income | $X | $X |
| Net appreciation (depreciation) | X | X |
| **Total investment return** | **$X** | **$X** |

---

### Note: 103-12 Investment Entity (Direct Filing Entity)

The Plan invests in [ENTITY NAME], a Direct Filing Entity ("DFE") as defined by Department of Labor Regulations Section 2520.103-12. The DFE files a separate annual report (Form 5500) with the Department of Labor.

As of [DATE], the Plan's investment in the DFE was $[AMOUNT], representing [X]% of Plan net assets. Information concerning the DFE, including its financial statements and supplemental schedules, is available in the DFE's separate Form 5500 filing.

The following summarizes the Plan's investment in the DFE:

| DFE Name | EIN/PN | Fair Value | % of Plan Assets |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| [ENTITY NAME] | [XX-XXXXXXX/XXX] | $X | X% |

---

### Note: Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs)

The Plan holds guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") with [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME]. These contracts provide a guaranteed interest rate over a specified period.

| Contract | Interest Rate | Maturity Date | Contract Value | Fair Value |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| [CONTRACT #1] | X.XX% | [DATE] | $X | $X |
| [CONTRACT #2] | X.XX% | [DATE] | $X | $X |
| **Total GICs** | | | **$X** | **$X** |

The contracts are fully benefit-responsive and are recorded at contract value. There are no reserves against contract values for credit risk of the contract issuers or otherwise. The crediting interest rate is based on a formula agreed upon with the issuer. The crediting interest rate is reviewed [quarterly/annually] for resetting.

The average yield and crediting interest rate for GICs were [X.XX]% and [X.XX]%, respectively, for the plan year ended [DATE].

---

### Note: Insurance Company Separate Account

The Plan invests in a separate account maintained by [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME]. The separate account is a pool of assets maintained by the insurance company for the collective investment of qualified retirement plan assets.

As of [DATE], the Plan's investment in the separate account was $[AMOUNT], representing [X]% of Plan net assets. The separate account is valued at the net asset value of units held by the Plan as determined by the insurance company based on the fair value of the underlying investments.

---

### Note: Insurance Company General Account

The Plan holds a group annuity contract with [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] that is invested in the insurance company's general account. The contract guarantees [principal / a minimum interest rate of X.XX%].

As of [DATE], the contract value was $[AMOUNT]. Contract value represents contributions plus accumulated interest, which is the relevant measurement for fully benefit-responsive contracts. The fair value of the contract was $[AMOUNT].

The Plan's ability to receive amounts due under the contract is dependent on the claims-paying ability of [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME]. The contract issuer is rated [RATING] by [RATING AGENCY].

---

### Note: Collective Investment Trusts (CITs)

The Plan invests in collective investment trusts ("CITs"), also known as collective trust funds or commingled funds. CITs are pooled investment vehicles maintained by a bank or trust company for the collective investment of qualified retirement plan assets.

The following CITs are held by the Plan as of [DATE]:

| Fund Name | Strategy | Fair Value | Redemption Frequency | Notice Period |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| [CIT NAME 1] | [Equity Index] | $X | Daily | None |
| [CIT NAME 2] | [Fixed Income] | $X | Daily | None |
| [CIT NAME 3] | [Target Date] | $X | Daily | None |
| **Total CITs** | | **$X** | | |

CITs are valued at the net asset value ("NAV") per unit as determined by the fund administrator based on the fair value of the underlying investments. The Plan's investments in CITs are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.

There are no unfunded commitments related to CITs. Participants may direct the redemption of their investments at NAV on any business day.

---

### Note: Unitized Employer Stock Fund

The Plan offers a unitized employer stock fund that invests primarily in common stock of [COMPANY NAME] and a short-term investment fund for liquidity purposes.

As of [DATE], the unitized fund held:

| Component | Fair Value | % of Fund |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| [COMPANY NAME] common stock ([X] shares) | $X | X% |
| Short-term investments (liquidity reserve) | X | X% |
| **Total unitized fund** | **$X** | **100%** |

The fund is valued daily based on the fair value of [COMPANY NAME] common stock (Level 1) and the short-term investments. Participants transact in units of the fund rather than directly in shares of company stock.

The short-term investment component provides liquidity for participant transactions and is maintained at approximately [X]% of fund assets. Investment in [COMPANY NAME] stock is subject to the diversification requirements under ERISA Section 204(j).

---

### Note: Non-Readily Marketable Employer Securities (Level 3)

The Plan holds common stock of [COMPANY NAME], the Plan Sponsor, which is a privately held company. These securities are not traded on an established securities market and are considered non-readily marketable employer securities.

As of [DATE], the Plan held [NUMBER] shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], representing [X]% of Plan net assets.

**Valuation Methodology**

The fair value of [COMPANY NAME] common stock is determined by an independent appraiser, [APPRAISER NAME], as of [VALUATION DATE]. The valuation considers:
- Discounted cash flow analysis
- Comparable company analysis
- Comparable transaction analysis
- [Other methodologies used]

**Fair Value Hierarchy**

These securities are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs.

**Level 3 Rollforward**

| | [CURRENT YEAR] |
|---|---------------|
| Balance, beginning of year | $X |
| Purchases | X |
| Sales | (X) |
| Net appreciation (depreciation) | X |
| **Balance, end of year** | **$X** |

The net appreciation (depreciation) of $[AMOUNT] is included in net appreciation in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The fair value of employer securities is sensitive to changes in the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation. An increase (decrease) in [discount rate / growth rate / valuation multiple] would result in a [lower/higher] fair value measurement.

---

### Note: ESOP Component

The Plan includes an employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") component that invests in common stock of [COMPANY NAME]. The ESOP component is designed to invest primarily in employer securities.

**Allocated Shares**

As of [DATE], the ESOP component held [NUMBER] allocated shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock with a fair value of $[AMOUNT], allocated to [NUMBER] participant accounts.

**Unallocated Shares (Suspense Account)**

*If applicable:*
As of [DATE], [NUMBER] shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock with a fair value of $[AMOUNT] were held in the ESOP suspense account pending allocation to participants. Shares are released from suspense and allocated to participant accounts as the ESOP loan is repaid. [Describe allocation method - shares or principal and interest method.]

**ESOP Loan**

*If applicable:*
The ESOP borrowed $[AMOUNT] from [LENDER] on [DATE] to purchase [NUMBER] shares of [COMPANY NAME] common stock. The loan bears interest at [RATE]% and is repayable over [TERM] years. As of [DATE], the outstanding loan balance was $[AMOUNT].

The loan is secured by the unallocated shares held in the ESOP suspense account. The Company makes annual contributions to the Plan to enable repayment of the loan.

**Diversification**

Participants who have attained age 55 and completed 10 years of participation in the ESOP may diversify a portion of their ESOP account balance in accordance with IRC Section 401(a)(28).

---

### Note: Dividend Pass-Through (Employer Securities)

Dividends on [COMPANY NAME] common stock held by the Plan may be:
- Reinvested in additional shares of company stock
- Distributed directly to participants in cash
- Used to repay ESOP loans

During the plan year ended [DATE], dividends of $[AMOUNT] were [reinvested / distributed to participants / used to repay ESOP loans].

*For pass-through dividends:*
Participants may elect to receive dividends in cash or have them reinvested in additional shares. For the plan year ended [DATE], participants received cash dividend distributions of $[AMOUNT].

---

### Note: Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

*For distributions of employer securities:*

Participants who receive distributions of [COMPANY NAME] common stock may be eligible for special tax treatment under IRC Section 402(e)(4) for the net unrealized appreciation ("NUA") on such stock.
