# State-Specific Considerations for 401(k) Audits

## Overview

While ERISA preempts most state laws governing employee benefit plans, several state-specific considerations remain critical for 401(k) auditors. This guide covers state income tax treatment, mandatory retirement programs, unclaimed property laws, community property rules, and other state-level compliance requirements.

---

## Part 1: State Income Tax Treatment

### States with No Income Tax (9 States)

| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Alaska | No state income tax on wages or retirement distributions |
| Florida | No state income tax |
| Nevada | No state income tax |
| New Hampshire | No tax on wages; tax on interest/dividends being phased out (eliminated 2025) |
| South Dakota | No state income tax |
| Tennessee | No tax on wages; Hall Tax on interest/dividends eliminated 2021 |
| Texas | No state income tax |
| Washington | No state income tax (capital gains tax on high earners enacted 2021) |
| Wyoming | No state income tax |

**Audit Implication**: Participants in these states receive full benefit of federal tax deferral without state tax considerations.

### States That Tax 401(k) Distributions

**Most states** tax 401(k) distributions as ordinary income. Key variations:

#### States with Retirement Income Exclusions

| State | Exclusion Amount (2025) | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-------|
| Alabama | Unlimited | All qualified retirement income exempt |
| Hawaii | Unlimited | Employer contributions exempt; employee contributions taxed |
| Illinois | Unlimited | All qualified plan distributions exempt |
| Mississippi | Unlimited | All qualified retirement income exempt |
| Pennsylvania | Unlimited | All 401(k) distributions exempt if retired |
| Colorado | $24,000 (age 65+) | $20,000 ages 55-64 |
| Delaware | $12,500 (age 60+) | Per person exclusion |
| Georgia | $65,000 (age 65+) | $35,000 ages 62-64 |
| Iowa | $6,000 | Per person; being phased to full exemption by 2026 |
| Kentucky | $31,110 | Excludes amounts from public pensions |
| Louisiana | $6,000 | Per person annual exclusion |
| Maryland | $34,300 (age 65+) | Pension exclusion |
| Michigan | Varies | Based on birth year; full exemption for those born before 1946 |
| New Jersey | $100,000 (married) | Income threshold; $75,000 single |
| New York | $20,000 | Per person exclusion |
| Ohio | $200 credit | Retirement income credit |
| Oklahoma | $10,000 | Per person for qualifying retirement income |
| Oregon | 9% credit | Retirement income credit for qualifying income |
| South Carolina | $10,000 | Per person exclusion |
| Virginia | $12,000 | Age deduction for 65+ |
| Wisconsin | $5,000 | Retirement income exclusion |

**Audit Implication**: When reviewing distributions, understand that state tax withholding requirements vary significantly.

### State Tax Withholding Requirements

#### Mandatory State Withholding States

These states **require** state income tax withholding on retirement distributions:

| State | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Arkansas | Mandatory if federal withholding elected |
| California | Mandatory withholding required |
| Connecticut | Mandatory if federal withholding elected |
| Delaware | Mandatory if federal withholding elected |
| Iowa | Mandatory 5% on lump sums |

## Part 2: State-Mandated Retirement Programs

### Overview

Many states have enacted mandatory retirement savings programs for employers who don't offer qualified plans. While these don't directly affect 401(k) plans, auditors should understand the landscape.

### Active State Programs (2025)

| State | Program Name | Effective Date | Employer Threshold |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| California | CalSavers | 2019-2022 (phased) | 1+ employees |
| Colorado | Colorado SecureSavings | 2023-2025 (phased) | 5+ employees |
| Connecticut | MyCTSavings | 2022-2024 (phased) | 5+ employees |
| Delaware | Delaware EARNS | 2025 | 5+ employees |
| Illinois | Illinois Secure Choice | 2019-2023 (phased) | 5+ employees |
| Maine | Maine Retirement Savings | 2024 | 5+ employees |
| Maryland | MarylandSaves | 2024-2025 (phased) | 1+ employees |
| Minnesota | MinnesotaSaves | 2025-2026 (phased) | 5+ employees |
| Nevada | Employee Savings Trust | 2025 | 5+ employees |
| New Jersey | RetireReady NJ | 2024-2025 (phased) | 25+ employees |
| New York | NY State Secure Choice | 2024 | 10+ employees |
| Oregon | OregonSaves | 2017-2020 (phased) | 1+ employees |
| Vermont | Green Mountain Secure Retirement | 2025 | 5+ employees |
| Virginia | RetirePath Virginia | 2024-2025 (phased) | 25+ employees |

### Programs Under Development

| State | Status | Expected Launch |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Hawaii | Legislation passed | 2026 |
| Massachusetts | Under consideration | TBD |
| Missouri | Program development | 2026 |
| New Mexico | Legislation passed | 2025-2026 |
| Rhode Island | Under development | TBD |
| Washington | Under consideration | TBD |

### Audit Implications

1. **Exemption Verification**: Employers with 401(k) plans are typically exempt from state mandates
2. **Documentation**: Plan sponsors should document exemption status
3. **Transition Situations**: When acquiring companies, verify proper handling of state program accounts
4. **Multiple State Operations**: Employers in multiple states may face different requirements

---

## Part 3: Unclaimed Property / Escheatment Laws

### Critical Audit Area

Unclaimed 401(k) benefits (missing participants, uncashed checks) are subject to state unclaimed property laws. This is a significant compliance area.

### State Escheatment Dormancy Periods

#### Short Dormancy (1-3 Years)

| State | Dormancy Period | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Delaware | 3 years | Major incorporation state |
| Georgia | 3 years | |
| Illinois | 3 years | |
| Kentucky | 3 years | |
| Louisiana | 3 years | |
| New Jersey | 3 years | |
| Pennsylvania | 3 years | |
| Texas | 3 years | |
| Vermont | 3 years | |

#### Standard Dormancy (5 Years)

Most states use a **5-year dormancy period** for retirement benefits, including:
- California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin

#### Extended Dormancy

| State | Dormancy Period |
|-------|----------------|
| Alabama | 5 years (15 for some property) |
| Arizona | 3 years (wages); 5 years (other) |

### Determining Applicable State

Priority rules for determining which state's law applies:

1. **First Priority**: State of last known address of participant
2. **Second Priority**: State of incorporation of plan sponsor (if address unknown)
3. **Third Priority**: State of plan administrator's location (if no incorporation state)

### Required Due Diligence Before Escheatment

Most states require:
1. **Letter mailings** (certified mail often required)
2. **Database searches** (SSA Death Master File, commercial locator services)
3. **Documentation retention** of search efforts
4. **Waiting periods** after due diligence attempts

### Audit Procedures for Unclaimed Property

```
□ Obtain list of missing participants and uncashed checks
□ Review due diligence procedures and documentation
□ Verify correct state law is being applied
□ Test dormancy period calculations
□ Review escheatment filing history
□ Verify proper reporting on state unclaimed property reports
□ Consider SECURE 2.0 provisions for missing participants
□ Test accuracy of last known addresses on file
□ Review procedures for deceased participants
□ Verify compliance with DOL missing participant guidance
```

### DOL Guidance on Missing Participants

Field Assistance Bulletin 2021-01 provides safe harbor steps:
1. Certified mail to last known address
2. Check related plan records
3. Check with designated beneficiary
4. Use free electronic search tools (SSA, USPS, internet)
5. Consider commercial locator services, credit reporting agencies, proprietary databases

## Part 4: Community Property States

### The Nine Community Property States

| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Arizona | Quasi-community property for assets acquired elsewhere |
| California | Quasi-community property rules apply |
| Idaho | |
| Louisiana | Civil law heritage |
| Nevada | Can opt-in to community property trust |
| New Mexico | |
| Texas | |
| Washington | |
| Wisconsin | Marital property state (similar rules) |

### Alaska Exception
Alaska allows **opt-in** community property via trust or agreement.

### Impact on 401(k) Plans

#### Spousal Rights Enhanced

In community property states, a spouse may have a **property right** (not just a survivor benefit) in 401(k) balances earned during marriage.

#### Audit Considerations

| Issue | Audit Procedure |
|-------|-----------------|
| Beneficiary Designations | Review whether spousal consent procedures are enhanced |
| Distributions | Verify spousal consent obtained for all distributions |
| QDROs | Expect higher QDRO volume; verify proper processing |
| Death Benefits | Community property interest may override beneficiary designation |
| Loans | Some plans require spousal consent for loans in CP states |

### QDRO Considerations by State

| State | Special QDRO Rules |
|-------|-------------------|
| California | Strong presumption of 50/50 split of CP portion |
| Texas | Inception of title rule may affect characterization |
| Louisiana | Civil code provisions may conflict with ERISA |
| Washington | Quasi-community property includes retirement earned in other states |

### Audit Procedures - Community Property

```
□ Identify if plan sponsor operates in community property states
□ Review spousal consent procedures
□ Test sample of distributions for proper spousal consent
□ Review QDRO log for proper processing
□ Verify beneficiary designation procedures include CP disclosures
□ Check if plan document addresses community property
□ Review procedures for participants who move between CP/non-CP states
```

## Part 5: State Securities Laws

### Blue Sky Law Considerations

While ERISA plans generally receive exemptions from state securities registration, certain considerations remain:

### Employer Stock Issues

| Concern | States with Active Enforcement |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| ESOP/401(k) employer stock | Texas, California, New York |
| Private company stock | Most states require exemption filing |
| Stock option exercises | State withholding varies |

### State Registration Exemptions

Most states exempt:
- Qualified retirement plans (401(k), pension)
- Distributions from qualified plans
- Investment options within qualified plans

**However**, plans with employer stock (especially private company) should verify:
1. Proper exemption claimed in each state
2. Blue sky filings current
3. Valuation requirements met

### Audit Procedures

```
□ Identify if plan holds employer securities
□ If private company stock, verify valuation by independent appraiser
□ Review state blue sky compliance for employer stock
□ Verify stock distributions properly reported
□ Check for state-specific disclosure requirements
```

---

## Part 6: State Payroll and Wage Laws

### Impact on 401(k) Contributions

State wage laws can affect 401(k) administration:

#### States Limiting Payroll Deductions

Some states require **written authorization** for payroll deductions:

| State | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| California | Written authorization required; specific form requirements |
| New York | Written authorization; cannot reduce below minimum wage |
| Illinois | Written authorization with specific language |
| Massachusetts | Written authorization required |

#### Minimum Wage Impact

Contributions cannot reduce pay below:
- Federal minimum wage ($7.25/hour)
- State minimum wage (if higher)
- Local minimum wage (if applicable)

### States with Higher Minimum Wages (2025)

| State | 2025 Minimum Wage |
|-------|------------------|
| California | $16.50/hour |
| Connecticut | $16.35/hour |
| Delaware | $15.00/hour |
| Illinois | $15.00/hour |
| Maryland | $15.00/hour |
| Massachusetts | $15.00/hour |
| New Jersey | $15.49/hour |
| New York | $15.50-16.50/hour (by region) |
| Rhode Island | $15.00/hour |
| Vermont | $14.01/hour |
| Washington | $16.66/hour |

**Major Metro Areas** (may have higher local minimums):
- Seattle: $19.97/hour
- San Francisco: $18.67/hour
- Los Angeles: $17.28/hour
- Denver: $18.81/hour

### Audit Procedures

```
□ Review payroll deduction authorization forms
□ Verify deductions don't reduce pay below applicable minimum wage
□ Test sample of employees near minimum wage
□ Verify compliance with state-specific authorization requirements
□ Check if plan permits catch-up contributions that might trigger issues
```

## Part 7: State Privacy Laws

### Emerging Compliance Area

State privacy laws increasingly affect 401(k) recordkeeping:

### Comprehensive Privacy Law States (2025)

| State | Law | Effective |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| California | CCPA/CPRA | 2020/2023 |
| Colorado | CPA | July 2023 |
| Connecticut | CTDPA | July 2023 |

| Texas | TDPSA | July 2024 |
| Utah | UCPA | December 2023 |
| Virginia | VCDPA | January 2023 |

### ERISA Preemption Question

**Unresolved**: Extent to which ERISA preempts state privacy laws for plan data

**Conservative Approach**: Many plan administrators comply with state privacy laws regardless of preemption arguments

### Audit Procedures

```
□ Review privacy notices provided to participants
□ Test data security procedures
□ Verify breach notification procedures in place
□ Review service provider contracts for privacy provisions
□ Check for state-specific privacy rights disclosures
□ Verify data retention/deletion policies
```
