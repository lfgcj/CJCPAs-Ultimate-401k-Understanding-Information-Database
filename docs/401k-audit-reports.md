## Components of the Audit Report

### Standard Audit Report Elements

Under SAS 136, the auditor's report must include:

#### 1. Title
Must include the word "Independent":
```
Independent Auditor's Report
```

#### 2. Addressee
Typically addressed to:
- Plan Administrator
- Plan Committee
- Plan Trustee
- Plan Sponsor

#### 3. Opinion Section

```
Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of [Plan Name], which 
comprise the statement of net assets available for benefits as 
of December 31, 20XX, and the related statement of changes in 
net assets available for benefits for the year then ended, and 
the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
[Plan Name] as of December 31, 20XX, and the changes in its 
net assets available for benefits for the year then ended in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America.
```

#### 4. Basis for Opinion

```
Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are required to be 
independent of [Plan Name] and to meet our other ethical 
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical 
requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion.
```

#### 5. Responsibilities of Management

```
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant 
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to 
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the 
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about [Plan Name]'s ability 
to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the 
financial statements are available to be issued.
```

#### 6. Auditor's Responsibilities

```
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that 
includes our opinion.

[Additional paragraphs describe the audit process]
```

#### 7. Supplemental Schedules Section

```
Report on Supplemental Schedules Required by ERISA

The supplemental schedules of [assets held for investment purposes, 
reportable transactions, etc.] as of December 31, 20XX, are required 
by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and 
Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
and are not a required part of the financial statements. Such 
supplemental schedules are the responsibility of management.
```

## Limited Scope Audit Reports

### What is a Limited Scope Audit?

Under ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), plans can limit the audit scope for investments held by banks, trust companies, or insurance carriers that provide certification.

### Limited Scope Report Components

#### Scope Limitation Paragraph

```
As permitted by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's 
Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA, 
the plan administrator instructed us not to perform, and we did 
not perform, any auditing procedures with respect to the 
information summarized in Note X, which was certified by 
[Bank/Trust Company], the trustee (or custodian) of the Plan, 
except for comparing the information with the related financial 
statements and supplemental schedules. We have been informed by 
the plan administrator that the trustee (or custodian) holds the 
Plan's investment assets and executes investment transactions. 
The plan administrator has obtained a certification from the 
trustee (or custodian) as of December 31, 20XX, and for the year 
then ended, that the information provided to the plan 
administrator by the trustee (or custodian) is complete and accurate.
```

#### Disclaimer on Certified Information

```
Because of the significance of the matter described in the Basis 
for Disclaimer of Opinion section, we are unable to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an 
audit opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion on these financial statements.
```

#### Opinion on Form and Content

```
Opinion on the Form and Content of Supplemental Schedules

The supplemental schedule(s) [identified] are the responsibility 
of the Plan's management. The supplemental schedule(s) has/have 
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of 
the financial statements and, in our opinion, is/are fairly stated, 
in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements 
as a whole.
```

### Certification Requirements

The certifying institution must provide written certification that:
1. Information furnished is complete and accurate
2. Prepared in accordance with GAAP
3. Includes all required elements
4. Signed by authorized official
