## Components of the Audit Report

### Standard Audit Report Elements

Under SAS 136, the auditor's report must include:

#### 1. Title
Must include the word "Independent":
```
Independent Auditor's Report
```

#### 2. Addressee
Typically addressed to:
- Plan Administrator
- Plan Committee
- Plan Trustee
- Plan Sponsor

#### 3. Opinion Section

```
Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of [Plan Name], which 
comprise the statement of net assets available for benefits as 
of December 31, 20XX, and the related statement of changes in 
net assets available for benefits for the year then ended, and 
the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
[Plan Name] as of December 31, 20XX, and the changes in its 
net assets available for benefits for the year then ended in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America.
```

#### 4. Basis for Opinion

```
Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are required to be 
independent of [Plan Name] and to meet our other ethical 
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical 
requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion.
```

#### 5. Responsibilities of Management

```
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant 
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to 
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the 
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about [Plan Name]'s ability 
to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the 
financial statements are available to be issued.
```

#### 6. Auditor's Responsibilities

```
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that 
includes our opinion.

[Additional paragraphs describe the audit process]
```

#### 7. Supplemental Schedules Section

```
Report on Supplemental Schedules Required by ERISA

The supplemental schedules of [assets held for investment purposes, 
reportable transactions, etc.] as of December 31, 20XX, are required 
by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and 
Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
and are not a required part of the financial statements. Such 
supplemental schedules are the responsibility of management.
```

#### 8. Signature, Date, and Location

```
[CPA Firm Name]

[City, State]
[Date of Report]
```

## Limited Scope Audit Reports

### What is a Limited Scope Audit?

Under ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), plans can limit the audit scope for investments held by banks, trust companies, or insurance carriers that provide certification.

### Limited Scope Report Components

#### Scope Limitation Paragraph

```
As permitted by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's 
Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA, 
the plan administrator instructed us not to perform, and we did 
not perform, any auditing procedures with respect to the 
information summarized in Note X, which was certified by 
[Bank/Trust Company], the trustee (or custodian) of the Plan, 
except for comparing the information with the related financial 
statements and supplemental schedules. We have been informed by 
the plan administrator that the trustee (or custodian) holds the 
Plan's investment assets and executes investment transactions. 
The plan administrator has obtained a certification from the 
trustee (or custodian) as of December 31, 20XX, and for the year 
then ended, that the information provided to the plan 
administrator by the trustee (or custodian) is complete and accurate.
```

#### Disclaimer on Certified Information

```
Because of the significance of the matter described in the Basis 
for Disclaimer of Opinion section, we are unable to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an 
audit opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion on these financial statements.
```

#### Opinion on Form and Content

```
Opinion on the Form and Content of Supplemental Schedules

The supplemental schedule(s) [identified] are the responsibility 
of the Plan's management. The supplemental schedule(s) has/have 
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of 
the financial statements and, in our opinion, is/are fairly stated, 
in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements 
as a whole.
```

### Certification Requirements

The certifying institution must provide written certification that:
1. Information furnished is complete and accurate
2. Prepared in accordance with GAAP
3. Includes all required elements
4. Signed by authorized official

## Compilation Engagements for 401(k) Plans

### What is a Compilation?

A compilation is an engagement where an accountant assists management in presenting financial statements without providing any assurance on those statements. Unlike an audit, the accountant does not verify the accuracy or completeness of the information.

**Key Distinction:** Under SSARS (Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services), compilations are governed by AR-C Section 80.

### Audit vs. Compilation: Critical Difference for ERISA Plans

| Aspect | Audit | Compilation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Assurance Level** | Reasonable assurance (opinion provided) | No assurance (no opinion) |
| **Standards** | GAAS/SAS 136 | SSARS/AR-C 80 |
| **Testing Required** | Yes - substantive and controls testing | No - only compiles information |
| **ERISA Compliant** | **YES** - Required for large plans | **NO** - Not acceptable for ERISA |
| **Independence Required** | Yes (must be independent) | Can disclose lack of independence |
| **Report Format** | Multiple sections with headings | Single paragraph, no headings |

**CRITICAL:** A compilation is **NOT acceptable** as a substitute for an audit when ERISA requires an audit (plans with 100+ participants with account balances). The DOL requires an audit by an Independent Qualified Public Accountant (IQPA).

### When Are Compilations Appropriate for 401(k) Plans?

Compilations may be appropriate in these limited situations:

| Situation | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Small plans (under 100 participants)** | Voluntary financial statements for internal governance |
| **Plan termination** | Financial statements for final distributions (if audit not required) |
| **Interim financial statements** | Mid-year statements for committee review |
| **Internal reporting** | Statements for plan sponsor management |
| **Non-ERISA plans** | Plans not subject to ERISA audit requirements |
| **Initial plan setup** | Baseline financial statements before first full year |

**Important:** Even when compilations are permitted, many plan sponsors prefer audits for fiduciary protection and due diligence purposes.

### Applicable Standards: SSARS 21-26 and AR-C Section 80

The current authoritative guidance for compilation engagements includes:

| Standard | Description | Effective |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **SSARS 21** | Comprehensive revision of compilation standards | December 2015 |
| **SSARS 22** | Compilation of pro forma information | May 2016 |
| **SSARS 23** | Omnibus amendments | October 2016 |
| **SSARS 24** | Omnibus amendments | May 2018 |
| **SSARS 25** | Materiality and adverse conclusions | Effective 2021 |
| **SSARS 26** | Quality management requirements | Effective 2025 |

All compilation engagements are now codified under **AR-C Section 80** of AICPA Professional Standards.

### Compilation Engagement Requirements

Under AR-C Section 80, the accountant must:

1. **Obtain engagement letter** signed by management
2. **Understand the entity** and its financial reporting framework
3. **Read the financial statements** to identify obvious errors
4. **Issue a compilation report** (always required)
5. **Document the engagement** per AR-C requirements

The accountant is **NOT required** to:
- Verify accuracy or completeness of information
- Obtain audit evidence
- Test internal controls
- Make inquiries or perform analytical procedures

### Standard Compilation Report - Employee Benefit Plan

The compilation report is distinctively formatted as a **single paragraph with no section headings**, making it visually different from audit or review reports.

#### Standard Compilation Report (Full Disclosure)

```
Accountant's Compilation Report

To the Plan Administrator and Participants of
[PLAN NAME]

Management is responsible for the accompanying financial statements
of [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net
assets available for benefits as of December 31, 20XX, and the
related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits
for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. We have performed a
compilation engagement in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the Accounting
and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. We did not audit or
review the financial statements nor were we required to perform
any procedures to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
information provided by management. Accordingly, we do not express
an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of assurance on
these financial statements.

[Firm Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

#### Compilation Report - Management Omits Substantially All Disclosures

When management elects to omit substantially all disclosures required by GAAP:

```
Accountant's Compilation Report

To the Plan Administrator and Participants of
[PLAN NAME]

Management is responsible for the accompanying financial statements
of [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net
assets available for benefits as of December 31, 20XX, and the
related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits
for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. We have
performed a compilation engagement in accordance with Statements
on Standards for Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the
Accounting and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. We did not
audit or review the financial statements nor were we required to
perform any procedures to verify the accuracy or completeness of
the information provided by management. Accordingly, we do not
express an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of assurance
on these financial statements.

Management has elected to omit substantially all the disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. If the omitted disclosures were included in the
financial statements, they might influence the user's conclusions
about the Plan's net assets available for benefits and changes
therein. Accordingly, the financial statements are not designed
for those who are not informed about such matters.

[Firm Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

#### Compilation Report - Known Departure from GAAP

When the financial statements contain a known departure from GAAP:

```
Accountant's Compilation Report

To the Plan Administrator and Participants of
[PLAN NAME]

Management is responsible for the accompanying financial statements
of [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net
assets available for benefits as of December 31, 20XX, and the
related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits
for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. We have performed a
compilation engagement in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the Accounting
and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. We did not audit or
review the financial statements nor were we required to perform
any procedures to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
information provided by management. Accordingly, we do not express
an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of assurance on
these financial statements.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America require that investments be reported at fair value.
Management has informed us that certain investments are stated at
cost, and that the effects of this departure from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America on
the financial statements have not been determined.

[Firm Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

#### Compilation Report - Accountant Not Independent

When the accountant is not independent but is permitted to issue a compilation:

```
Accountant's Compilation Report

To the Plan Administrator and Participants of
[PLAN NAME]

Management is responsible for the accompanying financial statements
of [PLAN NAME] (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net
assets available for benefits as of December 31, 20XX, and the
related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits
for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. We have performed a
compilation engagement in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the Accounting
and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. We did not audit or
review the financial statements nor were we required to perform
any procedures to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
information provided by management. Accordingly, we do not express
an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of assurance on
these financial statements.

We are not independent with respect to [PLAN NAME].

[Firm Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

**Note:** The accountant may, but is not required to, disclose the reason(s) for the lack of independence.

### Compilation Report with Supplementary Information

When supplementary information accompanies compiled financial statements:

```
Accountant's Compilation Report

[Standard compilation paragraph as above]

The [identify supplementary information] is presented for purposes
of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic
financial statements. The information is the representation of
management. The information was subject to our compilation
engagement; however, we have not audited or reviewed the
supplementary information and, accordingly, do not express an
opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any assurance on such
supplementary information.

[Firm Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

### Comparison: Audit, Review, and Compilation

| Element | Audit | Review | Compilation |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Opinion/Conclusion** | Audit opinion | Review conclusion | No assurance |
| **Procedures** | Extensive testing | Inquiry and analytical | Read for obvious errors |
| **Report Format** | Multiple sections | Multiple sections | Single paragraph |
| **Independence** | Required | Required | Can disclose lack |
| **ERISA Compliant** | Yes | No | No |
| **Cost** | Highest | Medium | Lowest |
| **Assurance Level** | Reasonable | Limited | None |

### Special Considerations for Employee Benefit Plans

#### 1. Supplemental Schedules

If supplemental schedules (such as Schedule of Assets) are compiled along with the financial statements, include the supplementary information paragraph shown above.

#### 2. Fair Value Measurements

Employee benefit plan investments should be reported at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined or cost is used instead, this is a GAAP departure that must be disclosed in the compilation report.

#### 3. Participant Data

Compilations may include participant-level data, but the accountant provides no assurance on the accuracy of such information.

#### 4. Form 5500 Integration

**Compiled financial statements cannot be attached to Form 5500 to satisfy the audit requirement.** For large plans requiring an audit, only an IQPA audit report is acceptable.

### When to Recommend an Audit Instead of Compilation

Even when a compilation is permitted, recommend an audit when:

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Plan approaching 100 participants | May need audit next year |
| Significant compliance concerns | Audit provides assurance |
| Fiduciary liability concerns | Audit provides protection |
| Complex investments | Need verification of values |
| Plan termination with issues | May need more thorough review |
| Mergers or acquisitions | Due diligence purposes |
| Prior compliance problems | Need independent verification |

### Documentation Requirements

For compilation engagements, document:

1. **Engagement letter** with scope and responsibilities
2. **Understanding of entity** and accounting framework
3. **Reading of financial statements** for obvious errors
4. **Significant matters** identified during engagement
5. **Communications with management** about issues found
6. **Final compilation report** issued

### Ethical Considerations

#### Independence Disclosure

Unlike audits, accountants need not be independent to perform compilations. However:
- Independence impairment must be disclosed in the report
- Cannot perform audits or reviews if not independent
- Consider client's needs when independence is impaired

#### Professional Judgment

Even in compilations, exercise professional judgment regarding:
- Obvious material errors or misstatements
- Fraud indicators
- Illegal acts by management

If significant issues are identified, consider withdrawing from the engagement.

Recommendation: We recommend the Plan Administrator implement a 
process to obtain beneficiary designations from all participants 
and periodically remind participants to review and update their 
designations, particularly after life events such as marriage, 
divorce, or birth of children.

Management Response: Management agrees and will implement an 
annual beneficiary designation review process beginning in Q1 20XX.
