## DOL Cybersecurity Guidance

### April 2021 Guidance

DOL issued guidance covering three areas:

#### 1. Tips for Hiring Service Providers

Plan sponsors should:
- Ask about cybersecurity standards
- Review service provider's security practices
- Evaluate track record
- Require cybersecurity provisions in contracts
- Assess SOC reports

#### 2. Cybersecurity Program Best Practices

Service providers should:
- Have formal cybersecurity program
- Conduct annual risk assessments
- Have third-party audits of security controls
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Have strong access controls
- Ensure data security and encryption
- Train personnel
- Have incident response plan
- Maintain business continuity plan

#### 3. Online Security Tips for Participants

Participants should:
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Keep contact information current
- Monitor accounts regularly
- Beware of phishing
- Use secure networks

## Plan Sponsor Responsibilities

### Fiduciary Duty

Cybersecurity is a fiduciary issue:
- Prudent expert standard applies
- Must protect plan assets
- Must protect participant data
- Oversight of service providers required

### Due Diligence

| Area | Actions |
|------|---------|
| Selection | Evaluate provider security |
| Contracts | Include security provisions |
| Monitoring | Ongoing oversight |
| Documentation | Record security reviews |

### Provider Selection Questions

Ask service providers:
- What cybersecurity framework do you follow?
- When was your last penetration test?
- Do you have SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports?
- What is your incident response process?
- How do you train employees?
- What encryption do you use?
- Do you have cyber insurance?

### Contract Provisions

Include in service agreements:
- Security standards requirement
- Breach notification obligations
- Indemnification for failures
- Audit rights
- Insurance requirements
- Termination for security failures

## Service Provider Requirements

### Security Program Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Governance | Defined responsibilities |
| Risk assessment | Regular evaluation of threats |
| Access controls | Limit system access |
| Data security | Encryption, data handling |
| Training | Employee awareness |
| Monitoring | Detect suspicious activity |
| Incident response | Handle security events |
| Business continuity | Maintain operations |
| Testing | Validate controls |

### SOC Reports

| Report | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| SOC 1 Type II | Controls relevant to financial reporting |
| SOC 2 Type II | Security, availability, confidentiality |

### Minimum Security Standards

- Multi-factor authentication
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Annual penetration testing
- Regular security awareness training
- Background checks on personnel
- Incident response plan
- Business continuity plan

## Participant Protection

### Authentication Requirements

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Strong passwords | Complex, unique |
| Multi-factor authentication | Additional verification |
| Security questions | Identity verification |
| Biometrics | Fingerprint, facial recognition |
| One-time codes | SMS, email, app-based |

### Distribution Safeguards

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Identity verification | Confirm participant identity |
| Hold periods | Waiting period for new bank info |
| Confirmation calls | Call to verify large distributions |
| Address verification | Confirm changes |
| Email/text alerts | Notify of transactions |

### Bank Account Change Procedures

Recommended safeguards:
1. Require verbal confirmation
2. Hold period before first distribution
3. Limit initial test distribution amount
4. Out-of-band verification (call, not email)
5. Documentation requirements

### Participant Communications

Educate participants on:
- Creating strong passwords
- Recognizing phishing
- Monitoring accounts
- Reporting suspicious activity
- Using secure networks
- Keeping information current

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Preparation | Develop plan, train team |
| Identification | Detect and assess incident |
| Containment | Limit damage |
| Eradication | Remove threat |
| Recovery | Restore operations |
| Lessons learned | Improve for future |

### Breach Notification

| Requirement | Timing |
|-------------|--------|
| Internal notification | Immediately |
| Service provider notification | Per contract |
| Affected participants | As required by law |
| Regulators | As required |
| Law enforcement | As appropriate |

### Documentation

During incident:
- Timeline of events
- Actions taken
- Parties notified
- Losses identified
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation steps
