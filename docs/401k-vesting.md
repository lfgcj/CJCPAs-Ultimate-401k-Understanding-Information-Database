## What is Vesting?

### Definition

Vesting is the process by which a participant acquires a nonforfeitable right to employer-provided contributions. A vested benefit is one that the participant is entitled to even if they leave employment.

### What's Always 100% Vested

| Contribution Type | Vesting Status |
|------------------|----------------|
| Employee pre-tax deferrals | Always 100% vested |
| Employee Roth deferrals | Always 100% vested |
| Employee after-tax contributions | Always 100% vested |
| Rollover contributions | Always 100% vested |
| Safe harbor employer contributions | Always 100% vested |
| QNEC contributions | Always 100% vested |
| QMAC contributions | Always 100% vested |

### Subject to Vesting Schedule

| Contribution Type | Vesting Schedule Allowed |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Employer matching | Yes (non-safe harbor) |
| Profit sharing | Yes |
| Non-safe harbor employer contributions | Yes |
| QACA safe harbor | 2-year cliff allowed |

---

## Types of Vesting Schedules

### Immediate Vesting (100%)

- Participant is fully vested immediately
- No service requirement
- Required for safe harbor contributions
- Simple to administer
- Maximum employee benefit

### Cliff Vesting

Participant becomes 100% vested after completing specified years of service:

#### 3-Year Cliff (Maximum for Matching)
| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 3 | 0% |
| 3 or more | 100% |

#### 2-Year Cliff (QACA Plans)
| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 2 | 0% |
| 2 or more | 100% |

### Graded (Graduated) Vesting

Participant vests gradually over time:

#### 6-Year Graded (Maximum for Matching)
| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 2 | 0% |
| 2 | 20% |
| 3 | 40% |
| 4 | 60% |
| 5 | 80% |
| 6 or more | 100% |

#### 2-6 Year Graded (Alternative)
| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 2 | 0% |
| 2 | 20% |
| 3 | 40% |
| 4 | 60% |
| 5 | 80% |
| 6 | 100% |

### Maximum Schedules by Contribution Type

| Contribution Type | Maximum Cliff | Maximum Graded |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Employer matching | 3 years | 2-6 years |
| Profit sharing | 3 years | 2-6 years |
| QACA safe harbor | 2 years | Not permitted |
| Top-heavy plan | 3 years | 2-6 years |

### More Favorable Schedules

Plans can always be more generous than the maximum:
- 2-year cliff instead of 3-year
- Faster grading (e.g., 2-4 years)
- Immediate vesting

---

## Vesting Service Calculation

### Year of Vesting Service

Generally, a year of service is:
- 12-month period
- With 1,000 hours of service
- Starting from hire date (employment commencement date)

### Hours of Service Methods

#### Actual Hours Method
- Count actual hours worked
- Include hours for paid time off
- Include hours for back pay
- Detailed recordkeeping required

#### Equivalency Methods

Plans can use equivalencies instead of actual hours:

| Method | Credited Hours |
|--------|---------------|
| Days worked | 10 hours per day |
| Weeks worked | 45 hours per week |
| Semi-monthly periods | 95 hours per period |
| Months worked | 190 hours per month |

#### Elapsed Time Method

Alternative to hours counting:
- Service counted in periods (years, months, days)
- No hourly tracking needed
- Year of service = 12 consecutive months
- Simplified administration

### Computation Period

The 12-month period used to measure a year of service:
- Usually anniversary year (from hire date)
- May shift to plan year after first year
- Must be consistently applied

### Part-Time Employees

- 1,000 hours threshold treats many part-timers differently
- Working 20 hours/week = 1,040 hours/year (qualifies)
- Working 19 hours/week = 988 hours/year (may not qualify)

### SECURE 2.0 Long-Term Part-Time

Effective 2024 (deferrals) and 2025 (vesting):
- 500 hours in 2 consecutive years = eligible for deferrals
- Reduced hour threshold for vesting credit

---

## Employer Contribution Types and Vesting

### Non-Safe Harbor Matching

Subject to plan's vesting schedule:
- Maximum 3-year cliff OR
- Maximum 6-year graded
- Forfeitures of non-vested amounts

### Profit Sharing

Subject to plan's vesting schedule:
- Same maximums as matching
- May use different schedule than matching
- Often uses same schedule for simplicity

### Safe Harbor Contributions

Always immediately vested:
- Basic safe harbor match
- Enhanced safe harbor match
- Safe harbor non-elective
- Cannot impose vesting schedule

### QACA Safe Harbor

Special rule allows limited vesting:
- 2-year cliff vesting permitted
- Must be 100% vested after 2 years
- More generous than regular safe harbor
- Compensated by lower required match

### QNECs and QMACs

Used for testing corrections:
- Always immediately 100% vested
- Cannot be forfeited
- Special character maintained

---

## Breaks in Service

### One-Year Break in Service

A one-year break occurs when:
- Employee completes fewer than 501 hours of service
- During 12-month computation period
- May affect vesting calculation

### Rule of Parity

After consecutive breaks equal to or greater than prior vesting service:
- Prior vesting service may be disregarded
- Only if employee was 0% vested before break
- Service after return credited normally

**Example:**
```
Employee works 2 years (0% vested under 3-year cliff)
Employee leaves for 3 years
Returns to work
Prior 2 years may be disregarded
Starts fresh for vesting purposes
```

### Maternity/Paternity Leave

Hours credited for:
- Pregnancy
- Birth of child
- Placement of child (adoption)
- Caring for child after birth/placement
- Up to 501 hours credited
- To prevent break in service

### Military Service

Under USERRA:
- Service counts during military leave
- Must be reinstated upon return
- Vesting credit continues
- As if no break occurred

### Disability and Leave

Plans typically provide:
- Credit during approved leave
- Continued vesting during disability
- Per plan document terms

---

## Forfeitures

### What Are Forfeitures?

Non-vested employer contributions that participants lose upon termination.

### When Forfeitures Occur

- Participant terminates employment
- Was not fully vested
- Receives distribution of vested portion OR
- Incurs 5 consecutive breaks in service

### Timing of Forfeiture

**If distribution taken:**
- Immediate forfeiture of non-vested portion

**If no distribution:**
- After 5 consecutive one-year breaks
- Or per plan document if earlier

### Restoration of Forfeitures

If participant returns before forfeiture:
- Must restore forfeited amounts
- Upon repayment of distributed amounts
- Within 5 years of return (generally)

### Use of Forfeitures

Forfeitures must be used per plan document:

| Use | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Reduce employer contributions | Lower next contribution by forfeiture amount |
| Pay plan expenses | Use to offset administrative costs |
| Allocate to participants | Reallocate as additional employer contribution |

### Timing of Forfeiture Use

IRS guidance requires use within:
- Reasonable time after forfeiture
- Generally by end of following plan year
- Document in plan records

---

## Special Vesting Rules

### Top-Heavy Plans

If plan is top-heavy (key employees have >60% of assets):
- Minimum top-heavy vesting required
- 3-year cliff OR
- 6-year graded (2-6)
- Matches maximum normal vesting

### Plan Amendments

If plan vesting schedule is amended:
- Participants must have choice of:
  - Old schedule, OR
  - New schedule
- Election period required
- Cannot reduce vested percentage

### Change in Control

Plan may provide accelerated vesting upon:
- Sale of company
- Merger
- Change in ownership
- Plan termination

### Plan Termination

Upon plan termination:
- All participants become 100% vested
- Regardless of service
- Immediate full vesting
- Required by law

### Partial Plan Termination

If significant portion of participants terminated:
- Affected participants become fully vested
- 20%+ reduction triggers scrutiny
- Facts and circumstances test
- IRS may assert partial termination

## Plan Design Considerations

### Employer Perspective

**Reasons for Vesting Schedules:**
- Employee retention incentive
- "Golden handcuffs" effect
- Reduce benefit costs (forfeitures)
- Reward long-service employees

**Reasons for Immediate Vesting:**
- Competitive advantage
- Simplified administration
- Employee appreciation
- Required for safe harbor

### Employee Perspective

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the vesting schedule?
- What counts as a year of service?
- When will I be fully vested?
- What happens if I leave early?
- Can I return and retain vesting?

### Comparison of Schedules

**3-Year Cliff:**
- Simple to understand
- All-or-nothing at 3 years
- Higher forfeiture potential
- Strong retention for years 1-3

**6-Year Graded:**
- Progressive ownership
- Less "cliff" risk
- Lower forfeitures
- Retention spread over 6 years

### Administrative Considerations

Track carefully:
- Hire dates
- Hours of service
- Breaks in service
- Leave periods
- Vested percentages
- Forfeiture timing

## Vesting Examples

### Example 1: 3-Year Cliff

```
Employee hired: January 1, 2021
Plan: 3-year cliff vesting
Employer contributions: $5,000/year

End of 2021: $5,000 (0% vested) = $0 vested
End of 2022: $10,000 (0% vested) = $0 vested
End of 2023: $15,000 (100% vested) = $15,000 vested

If terminated:
- After 2 years: Forfeits $10,000
- After 3 years: Keeps $15,000
```

### Example 2: 6-Year Graded

```
Employee hired: January 1, 2021
Plan: 6-year graded vesting
Employer contributions: $5,000/year

End of 2021: $5,000 × 0% = $0 vested
End of 2022: $10,000 × 20% = $2,000 vested
End of 2023: $15,000 × 40% = $6,000 vested
End of 2024: $20,000 × 60% = $12,000 vested
End of 2025: $25,000 × 80% = $20,000 vested
End of 2026: $30,000 × 100% = $30,000 vested
```

### Example 3: Break in Service

```
Employee works 2 years (under 3-year cliff = 0% vested)
Terminates with $10,000 employer contributions
Forfeits entire $10,000

Returns after 3 years (break equals prior service)
Under rule of parity: prior 2 years disregarded
Starts vesting from scratch
```

### Example 4: Return and Restoration

```
Employee works 2.5 years (under 3-year cliff = 0% vested)
Receives $0 distribution (nothing vested)
$12,000 forfeited from account

Returns after 1 year
Prior 2.5 years restored
Now has 3.5 years = 100% vested
Previous $12,000 must be restored
```
