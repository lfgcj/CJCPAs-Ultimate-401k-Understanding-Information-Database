## Target Date Funds

### How They Work

Target date funds (TDFs) automatically adjust asset allocation as the target retirement year approaches:

- **Young Investors**: Heavy stock allocation for growth
- **Approaching Retirement**: Gradually shifts to bonds
- **In Retirement**: Conservative allocation for income

### Glide Path Example

| Years to Retirement | Stocks | Bonds | Cash |
|--------------------|--------|-------|------|
| 40 years | 90% | 10% | 0% |
| 30 years | 85% | 15% | 0% |
| 20 years | 75% | 25% | 0% |
| 10 years | 60% | 35% | 5% |
| At Retirement | 45% | 45% | 10% |
| 10 years after | 35% | 50% | 15% |

### "To" vs "Through" Retirement

- **"To" Retirement**: Glide path reaches conservative allocation AT retirement date
- **"Through" Retirement**: Continues adjusting after retirement date
- Important distinction for risk management

### Selecting Target Date Funds

Consider:
- Glide path methodology
- "To" vs "Through" approach
- Underlying fund expenses
- Asset class diversification
- Provider experience and track record
- Participant demographics

### Advantages

✅ Professional asset allocation

| Moderate | 50% stocks, 50% bonds | Balanced approach |
| Moderate Growth | 70% stocks, 30% bonds | Growth with some stability |
| Aggressive | 90% stocks, 10% bonds | Maximum growth potential |

### vs Target Date Funds

| Allocation changes | Yes, over time | No, stays constant |
| Participant action | None required | Must change funds as appropriate |
| Customization | Limited | Participant chooses risk level |

## Stable Value Funds

### Description

### Structure

```
Bond Portfolio (typically intermediate duration)
        +
Insurance Wrapper Contracts
        =
Stable Value Fund
```

### How Wrappers Work

Insurance contracts:
- Guarantee book value regardless of market
- Protect against interest rate fluctuations
- Smooth returns over time
- Maintain stable $1.00 share price

### Returns vs Other Safe Options

| Option | Typical Yield | Risk |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Stable Value | 2.5-4.5% | Very Low |
| Money Market | 0.5-2.0% | Negligible |
| Short-Term Bond | 2.0-3.5% | Low |

### Restrictions

Common stable value restrictions:
- **Competing Funds**: Cannot transfer directly to money market
- **Equity Wash**: Must go through equity fund first
- **Plan Termination**: May pay book or market value
- **Event Limitations**: Restrictions after certain events

### QDIA Considerations

Stable value funds:
- Only QDIA-eligible for initial 120 days
- Must move to other QDIA after that period
- Appropriate for capital preservation portion
