## When Is a First-Year Audit Required?

### The 100-Participant Threshold

A 401(k) plan requires an audit when it has **100 or more eligible participants** at the beginning of the plan year.

#### First-Year Audit Trigger Scenarios

| Scenario | Year 1 Participants | Year 2 Beginning | Audit Required? |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| New plan starts small | 50 | 50 | No |
| New plan starts large | 0 (new plan) | 150 | Yes - Year 2 |
| Rapid growth | 80 | 120 | Yes - Year 2 |
| Plan merger | 60 | 180 (merged) | Yes - Year 2 |

### Key Principle

**A brand new plan will NOT require an audit in its first year** because it had zero participants at the beginning of that plan year. However, if the plan has 100+ participants at the end of Year 1, an audit will be required for Year 2.

### Exceptions and Special Situations

#### Plans That Start Large

If an employer establishes a plan and immediately covers 100+ employees:
- Year 1: No audit (0 participants at beginning)
- Year 2: Audit required (100+ at beginning)

#### Spin-Off Plans

When a new plan is created from a spin-off:
- Count participants transferred at beginning of new plan
- If 100+ transferred, audit may be required in first year
- Consider plan establishment date vs. effective date

#### Merger Into New Plan

When plans merge into a newly established plan:
- Participants from predecessor plans count
- May trigger first-year audit requirement

---

## Types of First-Year Audits

### Scenario 1: New Plan - No Prior Audit

**Situation:** Plan is newly established, never been audited.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No opening balance from prior audit
- No prior year comparatives
- No predecessor auditor

**Audit Considerations:**
- Must establish opening balances through alternative procedures
- Single-year financial statements acceptable
- Extra focus on plan document and qualification

### Scenario 2: Plan Crossed Threshold - No Prior Audit

**Situation:** Plan existed for years but just crossed 100-participant threshold.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Plan has operating history
- Prior year(s) Form 5500 filed (Form 5500-SF)
- No prior audited financial statements

**Audit Considerations:**
- Opening balances from unaudited records
- Prior Form 5500-SF as reference point
- May need to verify historical transactions

### Scenario 3: First Audit After Predecessor Auditor

**Situation:** Different auditor conducted prior year audit.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Prior audited financial statements exist
- Must communicate with predecessor auditor
- See [Predecessor Auditor Procedures](401k-predecessor-auditor.md)

---

## Pre-Engagement Considerations

### Engagement Acceptance Evaluation

| Factor | Consideration | W/P Ref |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Why no prior audit? | Verify legitimate reason (new plan, just crossed threshold, vs. auditor fired) | |
| Plan age | New vs. established plan | |
| Complexity | Plan features, investment structure | |
| Management integrity | Prior regulatory issues? | |
| Record availability | Will historical records be available? | |
| Competence | Do we have ERISA expertise? | |

### Risk Assessment - First Year Factors

| Risk Factor | Elevated Risk Indicators |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Opening balances | No prior audit to rely on |
| Historical transactions | May need to test prior periods |
| Control environment | No prior assessment |
| Plan document | Never reviewed for qualification |
| Participant data | No prior verification |
| Compliance history | No prior testing |

### Engagement Letter Considerations

First-year engagement letters should address:

```
Special First-Year Provisions:

1. Scope regarding opening balances
2. Limitations if prior records unavailable
3. Potential for qualified opinion if opening balances
   cannot be verified
4. Additional procedures required for first-year audit
5. Potential fee impact of additional procedures
```

---

## Planning Considerations

### Information Requests - Additional Items for First Year

In addition to standard PBC items, request:

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Plan establishment documents | Verify plan inception date |
| Original plan document | Confirm initial provisions |
| All plan amendments since inception | Document evolution |
| IRS determination/opinion letter | Confirm initial qualification |
| All prior Form 5500/5500-SF filings | Historical reference |
| Historical participant counts | Understand growth pattern |
| Board resolutions authorizing plan | Corporate authority |
| Initial trust agreement | Establish trust inception |
| Historical trust statements | Opening balance support |
| Prior year-end trust statement | Opening balance verification |

### Materiality Considerations

First-year materiality may require adjustment:

| Factor | Impact on Materiality |
|--------|----------------------|
| Opening balance uncertainty | Consider lower materiality |
| No prior period comparison | Less analytical review possible |
| Increased inherent risk | May warrant lower performance materiality |
| Limited control history | Consider additional substantive testing |

## Opening Balance Procedures

### Importance of Opening Balances

In a first-year audit, opening balances are critical because:
- Net change in assets depends on correct opening position
- Participant account accuracy requires correct starting point
- Investment gains/losses calculated from beginning values
- No prior audit provides assurance on opening balances

### Procedures to Verify Opening Balances

#### Step 1: Obtain Prior Period Documentation

| Document | Purpose | Obtained |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Prior year trust statements (12/31) | Total plan assets | [ ] |
| Prior year participant statements | Account balances by participant | [ ] |
| Prior year Form 5500/5500-SF | Reported assets and participant count | [ ] |
| Prior year investment certifications | Investment values | [ ] |
| Prior year recordkeeper reports | Detailed account breakdown | [ ] |

#### Step 2: Reconciliation Procedures

```
OPENING BALANCE RECONCILIATION

                                    Per Trust    Per Records    Difference
Total Investments - Beginning       $________    $________      $________
Participant Loans - Beginning       $________    $________      $________
Receivables - Beginning             $________    $________      $________
Cash - Beginning                    $________    $________      $________
Total Assets - Beginning            $________    $________      $________
Liabilities - Beginning             $________    $________      $________
Net Assets - Beginning              $________    $________      $________

Reconciling Items:
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Conclusion:
  [ ] Opening balances reconcile - amounts verified
  [ ] Opening balances reconcile with adjustments (documented)
  [ ] Opening balances cannot be verified - potential scope issue
```

#### Step 3: Substantive Verification Procedures

| Procedure | Description | W/P Ref |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Obtain prior year certification | If plan was 103(a)(3)(C) eligible, obtain trustee certification | |
| Confirm prior year investments | Confirm existence at prior year-end | |
| Test rollforward | Select sample of participant accounts, rollforward to current year | |
| Reconcile to Form 5500 | Agree opening balances to prior Form 5500/5500-SF | |
| Test significant deposits | Verify contributions deposited near year-end | |
| Test significant withdrawals | Verify distributions near year-end | |

### Impact if Opening Balances Cannot Be Verified

| Situation | Report Impact |
|-----------|---------------|
| Minor uncertainty | Note in workpapers, no report modification |
| Moderate uncertainty | Consider qualified opinion on Statement of Changes |
| Significant uncertainty | Qualified or disclaimer on financial statements |
| Material prior period error discovered | Prior period adjustment, modified opinion consideration |

### AU-C Section 510 Considerations

Per AU-C 510, for first-year audits:

1. **Opening Balances** - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
2. **Accounting Policies** - Verify consistently applied
3. **Prior Period Adjustments** - Identify any needed corrections

## Initial Qualification Verification

### Why Qualification Matters More in First-Year Audits

- No prior auditor verified qualification
- Plan may never have been professionally reviewed
- Disqualification risk higher for newer plans
- Common startup errors may exist

### Qualification Verification Procedures

| Procedure | Description | W/P Ref |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Obtain IRS letter | Determination (individually designed) or opinion letter (pre-approved) | |
| Verify plan type | Confirm plan document matches stated type | |
| Verify timely adoption | Plan adopted before year-end for deductions | |
| Verify effective date | Benefits provided from effective date | |
| Review for required provisions | Confirm required plan terms | |
| Check for disqualifying provisions | Identify prohibited provisions | |

### Common First-Year Qualification Issues

| Issue | Description | Correction |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Late adoption | Plan document not signed before year-end | May lose deduction for first year |
| Missing provisions | Required terms not in document | Amend and consider VCP |
| Incorrect effective date | Operations don't match document | Retroactive amendment may be needed |
| Late restatement | Predecessor plan not restated | Submit to VCP |
| Improper trust | Trust not properly established | Legal correction needed |

---

## Contribution Testing - First Year

### Unique Contribution Considerations

#### Partial Year Contributions

For new plans or short plan years:

| Situation | Testing Consideration |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Mid-year plan start | Contributions only for partial year |
| Pro-rata compensation | Verify compensation limited to eligible period |
| Limits | IRC 402(g) limit is annual, not prorated |
| Employer contribution | Timing and calculation for partial year |

#### Initial Deferral Elections

| Test | Procedure | W/P Ref |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Election timeliness | Verify elections made before compensation earned | |
| Default provisions | If auto-enroll, verify proper notice | |
| First contributions | Trace first payroll contributions to accounts | |
| Eligible compensation | Verify only eligible pay included | |

### Testing Template - First Year Contributions

```

## Participant Data Considerations

### Establishing Baseline Participant Data

First-year audit must establish data accuracy baseline:

| Data Element | Testing Focus |
|--------------|---------------|
| Date of birth | Verify to identification, critical for eligibility |
| Date of hire | Verify to HR records, critical for eligibility/vesting |
| Original entry date | Verify calculation per plan document |
| Historical hours | If service-based, verify hours tracking |
| Historical compensation | If testing requires prior years |

### Enhanced Eligibility Testing - First Year

| Procedure | Description | W/P Ref |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Population testing | Verify all eligible employees offered participation | |
| Exclusion testing | Verify excluded classes properly excluded | |
| Entry date accuracy | Recalculate entry dates for sample | |
| Initial participation | Verify enrollment procedures followed | |

### Historical Vesting Consideration

For plans where employees have prior service:

```
PRIOR SERVICE VESTING VERIFICATION

Participant: ______________________
Hire Date: ________________
Plan Effective Date: ________________
Years of Service at Plan Start: ________________

Vesting Schedule: [ ] Cliff ___ years  [ ] Graded: _____________

Prior Service Credit:
  [ ] Plan grants prior service credit for vesting
  [ ] Prior service counted from: ________________
  [ ] Vesting at plan inception: _____%

Verification:
  [ ] Prior service calculation correct
  [ ] Vesting percentage at year-end correct

Issues Noted: ________________________________________________
```

## Compliance Testing - First Year

### Nondiscrimination Testing - First Year Issues

| Test | First-Year Consideration |
|------|--------------------------|
| ADP/ACP Test | Partial year - annualize? Use actual? |
| Coverage Test | Count eligible employees for partial year |
| Top-Heavy Test | First year determination date |
| 410(b) Coverage | Partial year coverage calculations |

### First Year Top-Heavy Considerations

**Determination Date for First Top-Heavy Test:**
- Last day of first plan year
- Not prior year (no prior year exists)

**Minimum Contribution Requirement:**
- If top-heavy, 3% minimum applies
- Pro-rated for short plan year? Follow plan document

### Safe Harbor - First Year

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Safe harbor notice | Must be provided 30-90 days before year begins |
| New plan | Notice before effective date (or within reasonable time) |
| Mid-year safe harbor | Special notice rules apply |
| Contribution timing | Safe harbor contributions by year-end (match) or deadline (nonelective) |

---

## Short Plan Year Considerations

### When Short Plan Years Occur

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| New plan | Plan effective July 1, first year is 6 months |
| Plan year change | Calendar to fiscal conversion |
| Plan termination | Plan terminates mid-year |
| Merger/acquisition | Plan merged mid-year |

### Financial Statement Presentation

| Presentation | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| Statement period | Should reflect actual plan year (e.g., 7/1/XX - 12/31/XX) |
| Comparative statements | Not required for first year |
| Disclosure | Note should explain short year |

### Contribution Limits - Short Plan Year

| Limit | Prorated? |
|-------|-----------|
| 402(g) Employee Deferral | NO - annual limit applies |
| 415 Annual Addition | YES - prorated for short year |
| Compensation Limit | YES - prorated for short year |
| Catch-up Contribution | NO - annual limit applies |

**Example - Short Plan Year Limits:**
```
Plan Year: July 1 - December 31 (6 months)
Year: 2024

Contribution Limits:
  Employee Deferral (402(g)):    $23,000 (full year)
  Catch-up (if eligible):        $7,500 (full year)
  415 Annual Addition:           $69,000 × 6/12 = $34,500
  Compensation Limit:            $345,000 × 6/12 = $172,500
```

### Testing Adjustments for Short Year

| Area | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Sample size | May reduce if fewer transactions |
| Analytical procedures | Limited comparison available |
| Internal controls | Full assessment still required |
| Materiality | Base on actual net assets |

---

## Financial Statement Presentation

### First-Year Statement of Net Assets

| Presentation Options | Notes |
|---------------------|-------|
| Single year presentation | Acceptable and common |
| No comparative required | Prior year doesn't exist |
| Opening balance note | May disclose beginning of year if applicable |

### First-Year Statement of Changes

| Presentation | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| Current year activity | Full disclosure of all additions and deductions |
| Beginning balance | Zero for new plan; or opening balance if plan existed |
| Ending balance | Must agree to Statement of Net Assets |

### Required Note Disclosures - First Year

| Disclosure | Special First-Year Consideration |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Plan description | Include plan inception/effective date |
| Significant accounting policies | State this is first year of audit |
| Tax status | Note determination letter status |
| Short plan year | If applicable, explain reason |
| Opening balances | If plan existed prior, explain source |

### Sample Note Disclosure - First Year Audit

```
Note X - First Year of Audit

The Plan was established effective [date] and this represents the
first year for which an audit of the Plan's financial statements
has been performed. [The Plan was previously exempt from audit
requirements as it had fewer than 100 eligible participants at
the beginning of prior plan years.]

OR

The Plan was established effective July 1, 2024, resulting in a
short initial plan year of six months. Accordingly, these
financial statements cover the period from July 1, 2024 through
December 31, 2024.
```

|-------|-------------|------------|
| Missing plan documents | Original documents not retained | Maintain complete files from inception |
| Missing elections | Initial deferral elections not on file | Establish filing procedures |
| No enrollment evidence | Can't prove employees offered participation | Document enrollment meetings |
| Missing corporate authority | No board resolution for plan | Obtain proper authorization |

### Operational Issues

| Issue | Description | Correction |
|-------|-------------|------------|

## Report Considerations - First Year Audits

### When Unmodified Opinion Is Appropriate

- Opening balances verified through alternative procedures
- No material scope limitations
- All first-year issues resolved

### When Modified Opinion May Be Needed

| Situation | Potential Modification |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Opening balances cannot be verified | Qualified opinion on Statement of Changes |
| Material prior period error | Prior period adjustment, possible qualification |
| Significant scope limitation | Qualified or disclaimer |
| Going concern (plan terminating) | Emphasis paragraph |

### Sample Report Language - First Year

If opening balances verified:
```
[Standard limited scope report - no modification needed]
```

If opening balances NOT verified:
```
Basis for Qualified Opinion

We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
about the opening balances as of January 1, 20XX. We were unable
to determine whether adjustments to opening balances were
necessary. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether
adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the statement
of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year
ended December 31, 20XX.

Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter
described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section...
