## Required Minimum Distributions

### RMD Basics

After reaching RMD age, participants must take minimum distributions or face severe penalties.

### RMD Age (SECURE Acts)

| Birth Year | RMD Begins |
|------------|------------|
| 1950 or earlier | 70½ |
| 1951-1959 | 73 |
| 1960 or later | 75 |

### Still Working Exception

If participant is:
- Still employed by plan sponsor, AND
- Not a 5% owner

Can delay RMDs until retirement (for that employer's plan only).

### RMD Calculation

```
Account Balance (Dec 31 prior year)
÷
Life Expectancy Factor (IRS Table)
=
Required Minimum Distribution
```

**Example:**
```
Account Balance: $500,000
Age: 75
Life Expectancy Factor: 24.6

RMD = $500,000 ÷ 24.6 = $20,325
```

### IRS Life Expectancy Tables

| Age | Uniform Table Factor | Age | Factor |
|-----|---------------------|-----|--------|
| 73 | 26.5 | 80 | 20.2 |
| 74 | 25.5 | 85 | 16.0 |
| 75 | 24.6 | 90 | 12.2 |
| 76 | 23.7 | 95 | 8.9 |
| 77 | 22.9 | 100 | 6.4 |

### RMD Deadline

| Situation | Deadline |
|-----------|----------|
| First RMD | April 1 of year after reaching RMD age |
| Subsequent RMDs | December 31 each year |
| Death | Beneficiary rules apply |

**Warning:** Delaying first RMD to April 1 means two RMDs in same year.

### Penalty for Missing RMD

- **Pre-SECURE 2.0**: 50% excise tax on shortfall
- **SECURE 2.0**: Reduced to 25%
- **If corrected timely**: Reduced to 10%

### Roth 401(k) RMD Changes

Under SECURE 2.0 (effective 2024):
- Roth 401(k) no longer subject to lifetime RMDs
- Same treatment as Roth IRA
- Still subject to death distribution rules

## Distribution Planning Strategies

### Tax Optimization

   - Take more in low-income years
   - Avoid bunching in high-bracket years

2. **Roth conversions**
   - Convert in low-income years
   - Fill up lower brackets
   - Reduce future RMDs

3. **QCDs (from IRA)**
   - After rolling over to IRA
   - Qualified charitable distributions
   - Satisfy RMD without income

### Timing Strategies

1. **Delay if working**
   - Use still-working exception
   - Continue tax-deferred growth
   - Consider other income sources

2. **Start early if needed**
   - Age 55 separation rule
   - 72(t) payments
   - Balance current needs with future

### Rollover Decisions

Consider keeping in 401(k) for:
- Age 55 penalty-free access
- Creditor protection (ERISA)
- Stable value options
- NUA opportunity

Consider rolling to IRA for:
- More investment options
- Potentially lower fees
