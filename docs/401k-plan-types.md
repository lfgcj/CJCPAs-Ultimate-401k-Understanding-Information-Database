## Traditional 401(k) Plan

### Description

The traditional 401(k) is the most common type of retirement plan. It allows employees to make pre-tax contributions and employers to make matching or profit-sharing contributions.

### Key Features

- **Employee Deferrals**: Pre-tax contributions up to annual limit
- **Employer Contributions**: Optional matching and profit-sharing
- **Nondiscrimination Testing**: Required annually (ADP/ACP tests)
- **Vesting**: May have vesting schedules for employer contributions
- **Flexibility**: Wide range of design options

### Testing Requirements

Traditional 401(k) plans must pass annual nondiscrimination tests:

#### ADP Test (Actual Deferral Percentage)
Compares average deferral rates between HCEs and NHCEs:

| If NHCE Average Is: | HCE Maximum Is: |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 0% - 2% | NHCE rate × 2 |
| 2% - 8% | NHCE rate + 2% |
| Over 8% | NHCE rate × 1.25 |

#### ACP Test (Actual Contribution Percentage)
Same structure as ADP but for matching and after-tax contributions.

#### Top-Heavy Test
Plan is top-heavy if key employees have more than 60% of plan assets. If top-heavy:
- Minimum 3% contribution required for NHCEs
- Accelerated vesting required

### Advantages

✅ Maximum flexibility in plan design
✅ Employer contributions are discretionary
✅ Wide range of vesting schedules allowed
✅ Can be combined with profit sharing

### Disadvantages

❌ Annual testing required
❌ Testing failures require corrections
❌ HCE contributions may be limited
❌ More administrative complexity

### Best For

- Large employers
- Companies with stable workforce demographics
- Employers wanting maximum design flexibility
- Organizations with resources for testing and administration

## Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan

### Description

Safe Harbor 401(k) plans automatically satisfy the ADP and ACP nondiscrimination tests by providing specified minimum employer contributions. This allows highly compensated employees to contribute the maximum without restriction.

### Safe Harbor Contribution Types

#### Basic Safe Harbor Match
- 100% match on first 3% of compensation
- 50% match on next 2% of compensation
- Maximum match: 4% of compensation

```
Employee Defers   →   Employer Matches
3%                    3.0% (100% × 3%)
4%                    3.5% (3% + 50% × 1%)
5%+                   4.0% (3% + 50% × 2%)
```

#### Enhanced Safe Harbor Match
- More generous than basic formula
- Must meet minimum at each deferral level
- Example: 100% match on first 4%

#### Non-Elective Contribution
- 3% of compensation to all eligible employees
- Regardless of whether employee defers
- No contribution required from employee

#### QACA Safe Harbor (see QACA section below)
- Slightly reduced match (3.5% maximum)
- Must have automatic enrollment
- 2-year cliff vesting allowed

### Safe Harbor Requirements

   - Include enrollment information

3. **Cannot Be Amended Mid-Year** (generally)

   - Limited exceptions for financial hardship
   - Can add but not reduce mid-year

4. **No Last-Day Requirement Allowed**
   - All eligible employees get contribution
   - Cannot exclude terminated participants

### Testing Relief

Safe harbor plans are exempt from:
- ADP test
- ACP test (if match is safe harbor)
- Top-heavy minimum contribution (in most cases)

Still subject to:
- Coverage test (410(b))
- Compensation limit ($345,000 in 2024)
- Annual additions limit ($69,000 in 2024)

### Advantages

✅ No ADP/ACP testing

✅ Predictable employer costs
✅ Simplified administration

## Choosing the Right Plan Type

### Decision Framework

1. **How many employees?**
   - 0 (self-employed only) → Solo 401(k)
   - 1-100 → SIMPLE 401(k) or Traditional/Safe Harbor
   - 100+ → Traditional, Safe Harbor, or QACA

2. **Do HCEs want to maximize contributions?**
   - Yes → Safe Harbor or QACA
   - No → Traditional may work

3. **Is mandatory employer contribution acceptable?**
   - Yes → Safe Harbor, SIMPLE, or QACA
   - No → Traditional

4. **Is automatic enrollment desired?**
   - Yes → QACA or EACA
   - No → Other options

5. **Is testing administration acceptable?**
   - Yes → Traditional
   - No → Safe Harbor, SIMPLE, or QACA

6. **Are multiple employers involved?**
   - Yes → MEP or PEP
   - No → Single employer plan
