## A

### ACP Test (Actual Contribution Percentage Test)
A nondiscrimination test that compares the average matching contributions and after-tax contributions of highly compensated employees (HCEs) to those of non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). The test ensures HCEs don't receive disproportionately higher employer contributions. See also: [ADP Test](#adp-test-actual-deferral-percentage-test).

### ADP Test (Actual Deferral Percentage Test)
A nondiscrimination test that compares the average elective deferrals (as a percentage of compensation) of HCEs to NHCEs. If HCEs defer too much relative to NHCEs, the plan fails the test and must take corrective action. See also: [ACP Test](#acp-test-actual-contribution-percentage-test).
