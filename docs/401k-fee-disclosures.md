## Fee Reasonableness Evaluation

### DOL Guidance on Reasonableness

Fees must be "reasonable" under ERISA Section 408(b)(2):
- No specific dollar amount or percentage is "reasonable"
- Reasonableness depends on facts and circumstances
- Must consider services provided

### Evaluation Framework

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Services needed | What services does plan require? |
| Quality of services | What quality is being provided? |
| Fees charged | What is total cost? |
| Market comparison | How do fees compare? |
| Value received | Is value received worth cost? |

### Evaluation Process

```
Fee Reasonableness Evaluation:

1. Identify all plan fees
2. Understand services provided
3. Gather market data
4. Compare fees to benchmarks
5. Evaluate services vs. fees
6. Document findings
7. Take action if needed
```

### Factors Affecting Reasonableness

| Factor | Impact on Fees |
|--------|----------------|
| Plan size | Larger plans = lower per-participant fees |
| Complexity | More complexity = higher fees |
| Services | More services = higher fees |
| Investment options | More options may increase costs |
| Geography | Regional variations |

---

## Fee Benchmarking

### Benchmarking Resources

| Resource | Type |
|----------|------|
| 401k Averages Book | Annual publication |
| NEPC Survey | Investment consultant data |
| Plan Sponsor Council | Industry surveys |
| DOL resources | Government data |
| Competitive bids | Direct market comparison |

### Benchmarking Methodology

#### Step 1: Calculate Total Plan Cost

```
Total Plan Cost Calculation:

Administrative Fees:
+ Recordkeeping                 $50,000
+ TPA                           $25,000
+ Trustee                       $10,000
+ Audit                         $15,000
= Total Admin                  $100,000

Investment Fees:
Average expense ratio × Assets
0.50% × $50,000,000           $250,000

Total Plan Cost:              $350,000

Per Participant:
$350,000 / 500 participants     $700

As % of Assets:
$350,000 / $50,000,000         0.70%
```

#### Step 2: Compare to Benchmarks

| Metric | Plan | Benchmark | Variance |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Per participant | $700 | $650 | +$50 |
| % of assets | 0.70% | 0.65% | +0.05% |
| Admin per participant | $200 | $180 | +$20 |
| Average expense ratio | 0.50% | 0.45% | +0.05% |

### Fee Negotiation

| Approach | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Competitive bids | Obtain multiple quotes |
| Fee reduction request | Ask current provider to reduce |
| Service adjustment | Reduce services to reduce fees |
| Revenue sharing | Negotiate return of revenue sharing |

---

## Fee Litigation Considerations

### Common Litigation Claims

| Claim | Allegation |
|-------|------------|
| Excessive fees | Fees higher than reasonable |
| Revenue sharing | Failure to monitor/recapture |
| Investment options | Higher-cost options available at lower cost |
| Proprietary funds | Conflicts of interest |
| Recordkeeping | Above-market recordkeeping fees |

### Risk Mitigation

| Practice | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| Regular benchmarking | Demonstrates reasonableness |
| RFP process | Shows prudent process |
| Documentation | Evidence of review |
| Independent advice | Third-party validation |
| Committee meetings | Shows deliberation |

### Documentation Recommendations

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Benchmarking studies | Fee comparison |
| RFP responses | Market data |
| Committee minutes | Decision process |
| Fee negotiation records | Efforts to reduce costs |
| Advisor recommendations | Expert input |

### Committee Agenda Items

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Fee review | Review current fee structure |
| Benchmarking results | Compare to market |
| Service evaluation | Assess service quality |
| Negotiation outcomes | Report on fee discussions |
| Action items | Next steps if any |

### Red Flags

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Fees significantly above benchmark | Investigate, negotiate, or change |
| Unexplained indirect compensation | Request explanation |
| Frequent fee increases | Evaluate necessity |
| Poor service with high fees | Address or change providers |
