## What is a Limited Scope Audit?

### Definition

A limited scope audit is permitted under ERISA when:
- Plan assets are held by a qualified institution
- The institution provides certification
- The certification meets DOL requirements

### How It Differs from Full Scope

| Aspect | Full Scope | Limited Scope |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Investment testing | Complete | Relies on certification |
| Investment existence | Verified by auditor | Certified by institution |
| Investment valuation | Tested by auditor | Certified by institution |
| Investment transactions | Tested by auditor | Certified (partially) |
| Audit opinion | Unqualified possible | Disclaimer on certified items |
| Cost | Higher | Lower |
| Time | More | Less |

### Prevalence

Approximately 95% of 401(k) plan audits are limited scope audits.

## Auditor's Report

### Limited Scope Report Format

Per SAS 136, the report includes:

1. **Basis for Disclaimer paragraph**
   - Describes the scope limitation
   - References certification

2. **Disclaimer of Opinion**
   - States auditor cannot express opinion
   - Due to significance of certified information

3. **Opinion on Form and Content**
   - Of supplemental schedules
   - In relation to financial statements

### Sample Limited Scope Language

```
Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion

As permitted by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's 
Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA, 
the plan administrator instructed us not to perform, and we did 
not perform, any auditing procedures with respect to the 
information summarized in Note X, which was certified by 
[Institution Name], the trustee of the Plan, except for 
comparing the information with the related financial statements 
and supplemental schedules.

Disclaimer of Opinion

Because of the significance of the matter described in the 
Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion section, we are unable to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a 
basis for an audit opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on these 
financial statements.
```

## Full Scope vs Limited Scope

### When Full Scope Required

Full scope audit required when:
- No qualifying institution holds assets
- Certification not obtained
- Plan holds non-certifiable investments
- Plan administrator doesn't elect limited scope

### Reasons to Choose Full Scope

Even when limited scope available:
- Greater assurance desired
- Concerns about institution
- Fiduciary preference
- Litigation concerns
- Regulatory pressure

### Cost Comparison

| Plan Size | Limited Scope | Full Scope |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| $10M-$25M | $5,000-$12,000 | $8,000-$18,000 |
| $25M-$100M | $10,000-$20,000 | $15,000-$35,000 |
| Over $100M | $15,000-$40,000 | $25,000-$75,000 |

### Fiduciary Considerations

Committee should consider:
- Reliability of certification
- Institution's reputation
- Nature of investments
- Cost vs benefit
- Participant protection
