## Who Requires an Audit

### Large Plan Requirement

Plans with 100 or more eligible participants at the beginning of the plan year must obtain an audit.

### Counting Participants

**Eligible participants include:**
- Active participants with account balances
- Retired or separated participants with balances
- Deceased participants with beneficiaries owed benefits
- Participants eligible but not participating

**Does NOT include:**
- Former participants with $0 balances
- Individuals not yet meeting eligibility requirements
- Beneficiaries already receiving full benefits

### The 80-120 Rule

For plans near the threshold:

| Prior Year Count | Current Year Requirement |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Under 100 | Audit not required |
| 100-120 (was under 100) | May use prior year status |
| Over 120 | Audit required |
| 100-120 (was over 120) | May use prior year status |
| Under 80 | Audit not required |

**Example:**
```
Plan Year 2023: 95 participants (no audit required)
Plan Year 2024: 110 participants
Since 110 is between 100-120 and prior year was under 100,
plan may file as small plan (no audit required)

Plan Year 2025: 125 participants
Now exceeds 120, audit required
```

### Small Plan Exemption

Plans with fewer than 100 eligible participants:
- File Form 5500-SF (Short Form)
- No audit required
- Must meet additional requirements:
  - 100% of assets in qualifying plan assets
  - All required disclosures made
  - Plan is not a multiemployer plan

### First Year Audit Requirements

New plans:
- Count participants at beginning of plan year
- Usually no audit in first year (start with 0)
- Plan audit when cross threshold

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Auditors Check Everything"

**Reality:** Audits use sampling and testing procedures. Not every transaction is examined. Auditors test enough to form an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

### Misconception 2: "Clean Audit Means No Problems"

**Reality:** An unqualified opinion means financial statements are fairly presented. It doesn't mean there are no operational issues, compliance problems, or areas for improvement.

### Misconception 3: "Limited Scope Audits Are Inadequate"

**Reality:** Limited scope audits are specifically permitted by ERISA. They provide meaningful assurance while recognizing that investment custodians already certify that information.

### Misconception 4: "Auditors Work for the Plan Sponsor"

**Reality:** Auditors are independent. While engaged by the plan sponsor, their responsibility is to the plan and its participants. Independence is fundamental to audit value.

### Misconception 5: "Small Plans Don't Need Financial Oversight"

**Reality:** While audits aren't required, small plans still need proper oversight, internal controls, and compliance monitoring. Many small plan failures go undetected.

### Misconception 6: "Audits Are Just a Compliance Exercise"

**Reality:** Well-conducted audits provide valuable insights into plan operations, identify risks, and suggest improvements that benefit participants and sponsors alike.
