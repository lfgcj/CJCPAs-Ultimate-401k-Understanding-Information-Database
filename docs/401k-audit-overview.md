## Who Requires an Audit

### Large Plan Requirement

Plans with 100 or more participants with account balances at the beginning of the plan year must obtain an audit.

**Important - 2023 Rule Change:** Effective for plan years beginning January 1, 2023, the DOL changed the counting methodology. Plans now count only participants **with account balances**, not all "eligible" participants.

### Counting Participants (Post-2023)

**Count these participants (those WITH account balances):**
- Active participants with account balances
- Retired or separated participants with balances
- Deceased participants with beneficiaries owed benefits

**Do NOT count:**
- Former participants with $0 balances
- Eligible employees who have not enrolled (no account balance)
- Individuals not yet meeting eligibility requirements
- Beneficiaries already receiving full benefits

### The 100/120 Rule (Commonly Miscalled "80-120 Rule")

For plans near the threshold, there are only **TWO thresholds that matter: 100 and 120**. The number "80" is irrelevant.

| Prior Year Status | Current Year Count | Audit Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Small plan | Under 121 | No audit required (stay small) |
| Small plan | 121 or more | Audit required (must become large) |
| Large plan | Under 100 | No audit required (can elect small) |
| Large plan | 100 or more | Audit required (must stay large) |

**Key thresholds:**
- **100** = Point where large plans can drop to small
- **121** = Point where small plans must become large

**Example:**
```
Plan Year 2023: 95 participants with balances (no audit required)
Plan Year 2024: 110 participants with balances
Since 110 is under 121 and prior year was small plan,
plan may continue to file as small plan (no audit required)

Plan Year 2025: 125 participants with balances
Now exceeds 120, audit required
```

### Small Plan Exemption

Plans with fewer than 100 participants with account balances:
- File Form 5500-SF (Short Form)
- No audit required
- Must meet additional requirements:
  - 100% of assets in qualifying plan assets
  - All required disclosures made
  - Plan is not a multiemployer plan

### First Year Audit Requirements

**First-year plans follow different rules:**
- Count participants with account balances at **END of plan year** (not beginning)
- If 100+ at year-end → Audit required (unless short plan year deferral applies)
- **Short plan year deferral (29 CFR 2520.104-50):** If plan year is 7 months or less, audit can be deferred to Year 2

See [Audit Requirements - First Plan Year Rules](401k-audit-requirements.md#first-plan-year-rules---critical-distinction) for details.

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Auditors Check Everything"

**Reality:** Audits use sampling and testing procedures. Not every transaction is examined. Auditors test enough to form an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

### Misconception 2: "Clean Audit Means No Problems"

**Reality:** An unqualified opinion means financial statements are fairly presented. It doesn't mean there are no operational issues, compliance problems, or areas for improvement.

### Misconception 3: "Limited Scope Audits Are Inadequate"

**Reality:** Limited scope audits are specifically permitted by ERISA. They provide meaningful assurance while recognizing that investment custodians already certify that information.

### Misconception 4: "Auditors Work for the Plan Sponsor"

**Reality:** Auditors are independent. While engaged by the plan sponsor, their responsibility is to the plan and its participants. Independence is fundamental to audit value.

### Misconception 5: "Small Plans Don't Need Financial Oversight"

**Reality:** While audits aren't required, small plans still need proper oversight, internal controls, and compliance monitoring. Many small plan failures go undetected.

### Misconception 6: "Audits Are Just a Compliance Exercise"

**Reality:** Well-conducted audits provide valuable insights into plan operations, identify risks, and suggest improvements that benefit participants and sponsors alike.
