## Self-Correction Program (SCP)

### Eligibility

Plan must:

### Correction Period

| Failure Type | Correction Window |
|--------------|------------------|

### What Makes Failure "Insignificant"?

Consider:
- Number of employees affected
- Number of plan years involved
- Dollar amount involved
- Percentage of assets/contributions
- Reason for failure
- Other failures occurring
- How quickly corrected

### Insignificant Failures - Examples

Generally insignificant:
- Single participant eligibility error
- Isolated calculation mistake
- Inadvertent operational error
- Promptly corrected issue

### Significant Failures - Examples

Generally significant:
- Systematic errors affecting multiple participants
- Failures continuing multiple years
- Large dollar amounts
- Pattern of errors

### Documentation Requirements

Maintain records showing:
- Nature of failure
- How discovered
- Correction method
- Date corrected
- Participants affected
- Amounts involved

## Voluntary Correction Program (VCP)

### When to Use VCP

Use VCP when:
- Failure is significant

- Plan document failure
- Want IRS approval of correction

### Submission Requirements

VCP submission includes:
- Form 14568 (Model VCP Submission)
- Applicable schedules
- User fee
- Correction methodology
- Supporting documentation

### User Fees (2024)

| Plan Assets | Fee |
|-------------|-----|
| Under $500,000 | $1,500 |
| $500,000 - $10 million | $3,000 |
| Over $10 million | $3,500 |

### Grouping of Failures

One submission can include:
- Multiple failures
- Multiple years
- Related issues
- Single fee applies

### VCP Process

1. **Prepare submission** - Complete forms and schedules
2. **Pay user fee** - Using Pay.gov
3. **Submit to IRS** - Electronically via EPCRS
4. **IRS review** - May request additional information

- Then must identify plan
- Limited applicability

---

## Audit Closing Agreement Program (Audit CAP)

### When Audit CAP Applies

Used when:
- Plan is under IRS examination
- Failures discovered during audit
- Cannot use SCP or VCP

### Negotiation Process

1. IRS identifies failures
2. Plan proposes correction
3. Negotiate sanction

### Sanction Factors

IRS considers:
- Nature of failure
- Duration
- Number affected
- Steps taken to correct
- Employer's compliance history
- Whether voluntary disclosure

### Sanctions

| Factor | Impact on Sanction |
|--------|-------------------|
| Quick correction | Lower |
| Voluntary disclosure | Lower |
| Repeated failures | Higher |
| Large amounts | Higher |
| Willful failures | Higher |

5. **Submit to DOL regional office**
6. **Receive no-action letter**

### VFCP for Late Deposits

Interest Factor from DOL VFCP Calculator
Based on dates and IRS underpayment rate
```

### Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program (DFVCP)

**Reduced Penalties:**
| Plan Type | Per Day | Maximum/Year | Maximum Total |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------------|

| Large plan | $10 | $2,000 | $4,000 |

**Requirements:**

---

## Common Corrections

### Late Deposit of Contributions

**Correction Method:**
1. Deposit late contributions immediately
2. Calculate lost earnings (VFCP calculator)
3. Deposit lost earnings
4. Report on Form 5500 Schedule H

**Lost Earnings Calculation:**
```
Use DOL VFCP Online Calculator:
- Enter amount
- Enter payroll date
- Enter deposit date
- Calculator provides interest
```

### Excess Deferrals (402(g))

**Correction Method:**
1. Calculate excess
2. Calculate gap period earnings
3. Distribute by April 15 following year
4. Report on Form 1099-R

**If Not Corrected by April 15:**
- Double taxation
- Taxable in year deferred AND year distributed
- Earnings still taxable when distributed

### ADP/ACP Failures

**Correction Methods:**

| Method | Description | Deadline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Corrective distribution | Refund excess to HCEs | 2.5 months (no excise) |
| QNEC | Contribute to NHCEs | 12 months |
| QMAC | Match to NHCEs | 12 months |

### Excluded Employee

**Correction Method:**
1. Calculate missed deferrals (50% of missed opportunity)
2. Make QNEC equal to 50% of missed deferrals
3. Calculate missed match
4. Make QMAC equal to 100% of missed match
5. Fully vest corrective contributions

### Operational Failure - Eligibility

**Example:** Employee not enrolled when eligible

**Correction:**
```
Missed Deferrals = Compensation × Average Deferral Rate × 50%
QNEC = Missed Deferrals × 50%

If match:
Missed Match = QNEC × Match Rate
QMAC = Missed Match (fully vested)
```

### Loan Failures

**Correction depends on failure:**

| Failure | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Exceeds 50% vested | Reduce loan balance |
| Exceeds $50,000 | Report deemed distribution |
| Repayment term | Reamortize if possible |
| Payment frequency | Adjust schedule |
| Missed payments | Cure period or deemed distribution |

### Plan Document Failures

**Correction:**
1. Adopt corrective amendment
2. Operate plan per correction
3. May need VCP submission

## Correction Principles

### General Principles

1. **Full Correction**
   - Restore participants to position they would have been
   - No economic harm to participants

2. **Reasonable and Appropriate**
   - Correction fits the failure
   - Based on facts and circumstances

3. **Consistent**
   - Apply correction consistently
   - Similar facts = similar correction

4. **Forward-Looking**
   - Prevent future failures
   - Implement procedures

### Correction Methods Hierarchy

When choosing correction:
1. IRS-approved method (if available)
2. Method consistent with IRS examples
3. Method achieving full correction
4. Method that is reasonable

### Earnings Calculations

For corrective contributions:
- Use plan's investment returns
- Or use IRS underpayment rate
- Reasonable proxy method acceptable

### Documentation

Maintain records of:
- Nature and cause of failure
- Number of participants affected
- Dollar amounts involved
- Correction method used
- Dates of correction
- Measures to prevent recurrence
